{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yao", "content": "Emperor Yao ( simplified Chinese : \u5c27 ; traditional Chinese : \u582f ; pinyin : Y\u00e1o ; Wade\u2013Giles : Yao ; traditionally c. 2356 \u2013 2255\u00a0BCE) was a legendary Chinese ruler, according to various sources, one of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors .\n\nAncestry and early life\n\nYao's ancestral name is Yi Qi ( \u4f0a\u7941 ) or Qi ( \u7941 ), clan name is Taotang ( \u9676\u5510 ), given name is Fangxun ( \u653e\u52f3 ), as the second son to Emperor Ku and Qingdu ( \u6176\u90fd ). He is also known as Tang Yao ( \u5510\u582f ).\n\nYao's mother has been worshipped as the goddess Yao-mu (\u582f\u6bcd).\n\nLegends\n\nAccording to the legend, Yao became the ruler at 20 and died at 99 when he passed his throne to Shun the Great , to whom he had given his two daughters in marriage. According to the Bamboo Annals , Yao abdicated his throne to Shun in his 73rd year of reign, and continued to live during Shun's reign for another 28 years.\n\nIt was during the reign of Emperor Yao that the Great Flood began, a flood so vast that no part of Yao's territory was spared, and both the Yellow River and the Yangtze valleys flooded. The alleged nature of the flood is shown in the following quote:\n\nLike endless boiling water, the flood is pouring forth destruction. Boundless and overwhelming, it overtops hills and mountains. Rising and ever rising, it threatens the very heavens. How the people must be groaning and suffering!\n\nAccording to both historical and mythological sources, the flooding continued relentlessly. Yao sought to find someone who could control the flood, and turned for advice to his special adviser, or advisers, the Four Mountains (\u56db\u5dbd, S\u00ecyu\u00e8 ); who, after deliberation, gave Emperor Yao some advice which he did not especially welcome. Upon the insistence of Four Mountains, and over Yao's initial hesitation, the person Yao finally consented to appoint in charge of controlling the flood was Gun , the Prince of Chong, who was a distant relative of Yao's through common descent from the Yellow Emperor.\n\nEven after nine years of the efforts of Gun, the flood continued to rage on, leading to the increase of all sorts of social disorders. The administration of the empire was becoming increasingly difficult; so, accordingly, at this point, Yao offered to resign the throne in favor of his special adviser(s), Four Mountains: however, Four Mountains declined, and instead recommended Shun \u2013 another distant relative to Yao through the Yellow Emperor; but one who was living in obscurity, despite his royal lineage.\n\nYao proceeded to put Shun through a series of tests, beginning with marrying his two daughters to Shun and ending by sending him down from the mountains to the plains below where Shun had to face fierce winds, thunder, and rain. After passing all of Yao's tests, not the least of which being establishing and continuing a state of marital harmony together with Yao's two daughters , Shun took on administrative responsibilities as co-emperor. Among these responsibilities, Shun had to deal with the Great Flood and its associated disruptions, especially in light of the fact that Yao's reluctant decision to appoint Gun to handle the problem had failed to fix the situation, despite having been working on it for the previous nine years. Shun took steps over the next four years to reorganize the empire, in such a way as to solve immediate problems and to put the imperial authority in a better position to deal with the flood and its effects.\n\nBamboo Annals\n\nThe Bamboo Annals represent Yao as having banished prince Danzhu to Danshui in his 58th year of reign. They add that following Yao's abdication in favor of Shun, Danzhu kept away from Shun, and that following the death of Yao, \"Shun tried to yield the throne to him, but in vain.\"\n\nHowever, an alternative account found elsewhere in the Annals offers a different story. It holds that Shun dethroned and imprisoned Yao, then raised Danzhu to the throne for a short time before seizing it himself.\n\nLegacy\n\nOften extolled as the morally perfect and intelligent sage-king, Yao's benevolence and diligence served as a model to future Chinese monarchs and emperors. Early Chinese accounts often speak of Yao, Shun and Yu the Great as historical figures, and contemporary historians believed they may represent leader-chiefs of allied tribes who established a unified and hierarchical system of government in a transition period to the patriarchal feudal society. In the Classic of History , one of the Five Classics , the initial chapters deal with Yao, Shun and Yu.\n\nOf his many contributions, Yao is said to have invented the game of Weiqi (Go), reportedly to favorably influence his vicious playboy son Danzhu . After the customary three-year mourning period after Yao's death, Shun named Danzhu as the ruler but the people only recognized Shun as the rightful heir.\n\nAstronomical observations\n\nAccording to some Chinese classic documents such as Yao Dian (Document of Yao) in Shang Shu ( Book of Documents ), and Wudibenji (Records for the Five Kings) in the Shiji (Historic Records), Yao assigned astronomic officers to observe celestial phenomena such as the sunrise, sunset, and the rising of the evening stars. This was done in order to make a solar and lunar calendar with 366 days for a year, also providing for the leap month.\n\nSome recent archaeological work at Taosi , an ancient site in Shanxi , dating to 2300 BCE \u2013 1900 BCE, may have provided some evidence for this. A sort of an ancient observatory \u2013 the oldest in East Asia \u2013 was found at Taosi that seems to coincide with the ancient records.\n\nSome Chinese archaeologists believe that Taosi was the site of a state called Tang ( \u5510 ) conquered by Emperor Yao and made to be his capital.\n\nThe structure consists of an outer semi-ring-shaped path, and a semi-round rammed-earth platform with a diameter of about 60 m; it was discovered in 2003\u20132004.\n\nDynastic succession\n\nYao was claimed to be the ancestor of the Han dynasty Emperor Liu Bang . Other important noble families have also claimed descent through Yellow Emperor .\n\nNotes\n\nSources"}

He is best known for his work in graph theory .\n\nEducation and career\n\nBor\u016fvka was born in Uhersk\u00fd Ostroh , a town in Moravia , Austria-Hungary (today in the Czech Republic ), the son of a school headmaster. He attended the grammar school in Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b beginning in 1910. In 1916,\ninfluenced by the ongoing World War I , he moved to the military school (Realschule) in Hranice , and later he enrolled into the Imperial and Royal Technical Military Academy in M\u00f6dling near Vienna .\n\nWhen the war ended, Bor\u016fvka returned to Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b, finished his studies in 1918 at the Gymnasium there, and became a student at the Imperial Czech Technical University of Franz Joseph , in Brno , initially studying civil engineering . In 1920, Masaryk University opened in Brno, and Bor\u016fvka also began taking courses there. He became an assistant to Mathias Lerch at Masaryk in 1921, but Lerch died in 1922; his position at Masaryk was taken by Eduard \u010cech , whom Bor\u016fvka also assisted, earning his doctorate in 1923.\n\nAt \u010cech's suggestion, Bor\u016fvka visited \u00c9lie Cartan in Paris from 1926 to 1927. He earned his habilitation from Masaryk University in 1927, and (turning down an offer from the University of Zagreb ) he became a docent there in 1928. He continued to travel abroad through the late 1920s and early 1930s, to Cartan in Paris again as well as to Wilhelm Blaschke in Hamburg . He was promoted to assistant professor at Masaryk in 1934, given a chair in 1940, and made an ordinary professor in 1946.\n\nIn 1965, he founded the new journal Archivum Mathematicum , and in 1969, he became a founding member of the Institute of Mathematics [ cs ] of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences , splitting his time between the Institute and his professorship at Masaryk.\n\nContributions\n\nThe problem of designing efficient electric distribution networks had been suggested to Bor\u016fvka by his friend Jind\u0159ich Saxel, an employee of the West Moravian Power Company, during World War I. In his 1926 paper O jist\u00e9m probl\u00e9mu minim\u00e1ln\u00edm (English On a certain minimal problem ), Bor\u016fvka solved this problem by modeling it mathematically as a minimum spanning tree problem, and\ndescribed the first known algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a metric space (the set of cities to be connected by the network, together with their distances). Now called Bor\u016fvka's algorithm , his method works by repeatedly adding a connections between each subtree of the minimum spanning tree found so far and its nearest neighboring subtree. The same algorithm has been rediscovered repeatedly. It is more suitable for distributed and parallel computation than many other minimum spanning tree algorithms, can achieve linear time complexity on planar graphs and more generally in minor -closed graph families, and plays a central role in the randomized linear time algorithm of Karger, Klein & Tarjan (1995) .\n\nFrom 1924 to 1935, Bor\u016fvka's primary interest was in differential geometry .\nHis work in this area concerned analytic correspondences between projective planes , normal curvature of high-dimensional surfaces, and Frenet formula for curves in high-dimensional spaces.\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, Bor\u016fvka's interests shifted to abstract algebra , and in particular the theory of groups . He was also one of the first to study a generalization of groups, called by him \"groupoids\" but now more commonly referred to as magmas . A textbook by him on groups and groupoids, originally published in Czech in 1944, went through several expansions, and translations, including an English edition in 1976.\n\nFollowing the war, Bor\u016fvka shifted gears again, from algebra to the theory of differential equations . He published several research papers on this subject, as well as a monograph on second-order differential equations which he published in 1971.\n\nAwards and honors\n\nBor\u016fvka became a corresponding member of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences at its creation in 1953, and an ordinary member in 1965. In 1969, Comenius University in Bratislava gave him an honorary doctorate, and in 1994 he received a second honorary doctorate from Masaryk University in Brno .\n\nHe has also been given medals by the Free University of Brussels , the University of Li\u00e8ge , Jagiellonian University , Comenius University, Palack\u00fd University of Olomouc , Jan Evangelista Purkyn\u011b University in \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem , the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin , the Russian Academy of Sciences#Academy of Sciences of the USSR , and the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences."}
