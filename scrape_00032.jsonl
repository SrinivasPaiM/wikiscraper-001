The date of his birth is usually given as December 1782, but on the other hand the parochial register of Dollar, Clackmannanshire states that he died in 1829, aged 54. He received a classical education in the High School, Edinburgh , and in a private academy, and studied art under Alexander Nasmyth and in the Trustees' Academy , then taught by John Graham .\n\nFrom 1805 Gibson lived in Lambeth , exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1805, 1806, and 1807, and at the British Institution in 1811. In 1808 he was in Edinburgh, where he joined the Society of Associated Artists, to whose exhibitions he contributed till 1816, and he was represented in the modern exhibitions of the Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland in 1821 and 1822. In the earlier exhibition catalogues his name occasionally appears as \"Peter\" Gibson.\n\nIn 1826 Gibson became a founder member of the Scottish Academy , to whose exhibitions he contributed (1827\u20139) landscape and architectural subjects, both Scottish and foreign. In 1824 he had been appointed professor of painting in Dollar Academy , and he died there on 23 August 1829.\n\nWorks\n\nIn his works in oil, Gibson founded his style on Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin . His water-colours were executed with washes of subdued pigments. He was also an etcher, and published in 1818 a series of six Etchings of Select Views in Edinburgh .\n\nGibson contributed a comprehensive article on \"Design\" to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Edinensis ; and articles on \"Drawing\", \"Engraving\", and \"Miniature-painting\" to the Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia . His View of the Progress and Present State of the Arts of Design in Britain , in the Edinburgh Annual Register for 1816, noticed minor Scottish painters. He was author under the pseudonym of \"Roger Roundrobin, Esq.\", of a Letter to the Managers and Directors of the Royal Institution, Edinburgh in 1826. A treatise on Perspective , written shortly before his death, was printed but not published.\n\nGibson also contributed to the daily press; and David Laing ( Etchings of Wilkie and Geddes ) attributed to Gibson a notice of Andrew Geddes 's exhibition in the Edinburgh Evening Courant , 15 December 1821.\n\nFamily\n\nIn June 1818 Gibson married Isabella, daughter of William Scott, a teacher of elocution; and his wife is stated to have been a musician and the composer of the tune Comfort .\n\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain : Stephen, Leslie , ed.

Karl Popper supervised Musgrave's PhD which was completed in 1969. Musgrave worked as Popper's research assistant, initially then as a lecturer. Musgrave was appointed to the chair of the philosophy department at the University of Otago in 1970, and was head of department from 1970 to 2005. He was 30 years old at his appointment. Along with Imre Lakatos , a friend and colleague, they edited Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge (Cambridge University Press, 1970). It is the best-selling of the 4 volumes that record the Popper/Kuhn confrontation at the 1965 London Conference that Lakatos and Musgrave organised. In 1992 Musgrave published Common Sense, Science and Scepticism , an entry-level book on epistemology. In 1999 Musgrave published Essays on Realism and Rationalism (Rodopi), a collection of his scholarly papers. In 2006 Musgrave was honoured with a Festschrift : Rationality and Reality: Conversations with Alan Musgrave , edited by Colin Cheyne and John Worrall (Springer). In 2009, Musgrave published Secular Sermons: Essays on Science and Philosophy (Otago University Press), an entry-level book on science, religion and mathematics.\n\nAmong his non scholarly achievements is the Otago Philosophy's ranking in New Zealand's Performance Based Research Funding. In both the 2003 and 2006 surveys Otago's Philosophy department ranked as the best performing department among all academic disciplines in New Zealand. In 2010 the University of Otago embarked on a funding campaign to raise money towards a scholarship in his honour. In 2012 the University of Otago awarded Musgrave the Distinguished Research Medal, the university's highest research honour.\n\nPhilosophical work\n\nHis chief interest is in epistemology , history and philosophy of science , especially the Philosophy of Biology . The largest part of his career has been dedicated to the study of Charles Darwin . Throughout his career, he has defended scientific realism and scientific rationalism, and he is often considered their chief contemporary defender. He has attacked various forms of idealism ; most recently he attacked idealism by extending the argument popularly known as David Stove 's \" Gem \". Metaphysically speaking, Musgrave can be considered a nominalist; he argues for a position he specifically calls Pleonastic Platonism. This position basically claims that confusions within our language gives rise to Platonic entities. Pleonastic is a term with Greek roots meaning \"excessive\". Many of his works exhibit influence from Sir Karl Popper \u2013 his teacher as an undergraduate and postgraduate at the London School of Economics . He also shared an office with fellow philosopher Imre Lakatos while he was in London.\n\nHis form of Rationalism is subject, he admits, to circularity; but, he insists, it is better (even if only slightly better) than Poppers' Rationalism, which admits to irrationalism. However, his form of scientific realism is much stronger. His position does not assert that science is correct, only that we may reasonably accept certain parts of it to be correct. Electrons, for example, may not exist; but that does not mean we should not believe in them.\n\nHis main criterion for believing in a scientific theory is that it generates 'novel predictions.' He is one of the few philosophers of science, on either side of the debate, to stress the distinction between novel predictions and regular predictions. A novel prediction is one that was not used in the construction of a theory, but that nevertheless follows from it. If a scientific theory makes an accurate prediction about something unknown (as opposed to a known regularity), then the theory must either be true, or the accurate 'novel' prediction was miraculously guessed. This argument had previously been applied to all scientific predictions, by many philosophers of science (the most famous, perhaps, being Hilary Putnam , who coined the clause 'Realism is the only philosophy that doesn't make science a miracle'). This aphorism however, has been criticised as being merely a chimera of sophism, used mostly for its seductive force rather than its substance. Nevertheless, Professor Musgrave is in a smaller group by stressing that the argument can only succeed if applied solely to novel predictions. This claim however, cannot be defended logically as it commits the petitio principii fallacy of assuming, without adequate justification, the conclusion it is supposed to defend. However, while admitting circularity within the argument (in that \"miracle arguments\" seek to justify scientific \"inference to the best explanation\" by use of an inference to the best explanation), Musgrave defends his stance as one making a conclusion about rational belief rather than truth. Because he makes this distinction about knowing for certain that a theory is right, and reasonably believing that a theory is right, he evades many classical objections to realism.\n\nMusgrave's scientific realism\n\nTraditional scientific realism is the view that:\n\nMusgrave's scientific realism is the view that:\n\nIn the latter argument, premise 1) is still highly controversial, but it has been argued to be less so than premise 1) of the former argument. He argues for the latter premises 1) with such things as the Miracle Argument and novel predictions (above). In this way, he tries to do away with many sceptical objections about realism: he is no more wrong to believe in a theory's truth than an instrumentalist is to believe in a theory's usefulness, but that alone neither justifies nor warrants his claim that the theory is true. Both philosophers have the same chance of being wrong; and, with scientific realism, Musgrave also receives an explanation of events that the instrumentalist does not have. He often says that instrumentalists say the name of the game is \"saving the phenomena,\" but he sees no reason that it should not also be \"explaining the phenomena.\"\n\nAs for criticism of premise 1) in the latter argument, anti-realists point out that such a principle can only be justified through circular reasoning . For instance, to arrive at justification of 1), the best one can do is argue that this principle has escaped serious criticism and therefore is reasonable to accept. But why should one accept the corollary principle of \"a principle that has escaped serious criticism is reasonable to accept\"? The reply is that it itself is a principle that has escaped serious criticism. This boot-strapping is an unavoidable consequence of Musgrave's critical rationalism . Musgrave openly admits the circularity of his view, however he is quick to point out that anti-realism has nothing better to offer, and indeed, that not all circles are so vicious."}
