{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumigation", "content": "Fumigation is a method of pest control or the removal of harmful microorganisms by completely filling an area with gaseous pesticides , or fumigants , to suffocate or poison the pests within. It is used to control pests in buildings (structural fumigation), soil, grain, and produce. Fumigation is also used during the processing of goods for import  or export to prevent the transfer of exotic organisms .\n\nStructural fumigation targets pests inside buildings (usually residences), including pests that inhabit the physical structure itself, such as woodborers and drywood termites . Commodity fumigation, on the other hand, is also to be conducted inside a physical structure, such as a storage unit, but it aims to eliminate pests from infesting physical goods, usually food products, by killing pests within the container which will house them.\n\nEach fumigation lasts for a certain duration. This is because after spraying the pesticides, or fumigants, only the pests around are eradicated.\n\nProcess\n\nFumigation generally involves the following phases: first, humans are evacuated from the area intended for fumigation and the area covered to create a sealed environment. Next, the fumigant is released into the space to be fumigated. The space is held for a set period while the fumigant gas percolates through the space and acts on/kills any infestation in the area. Finally, the space is ventilated so that the poisonous gases are allowed to escape from the space, rendering it safe for humans to enter. If successful, the fumigated area is now safe and pest free.\n\nTent fumigation\n\nStructural fumigation techniques differ from building to building. In a residential setting, a \"rubber\" tent or tents, typically made of plastic/pvc coated canvas material, may be placed over the entire structure while the pesticides are being released into the vacant structure. This process is called tent fumigation, or \"tenting\". The sealed tent contains the poisonous gases and prevents them from escaping into the environment. This process is commonly used for the treatment of drywood termites and/or bedbugs, using sulfuryl fluoride as the pesticide (sulfuryl fluoride is a naturally occurring gas, used in much higher concentration than found in the natural atmosphere, and which leaves no physical residue). The fumigated structure can be re-occupied after the tent has been removed and the pesticide has dissipated to a safe level, with no need for physical cleaning.\n\nOperating theatres\n\nFumigation of hospital rooms with high concentrations of toxic chemicals has been proposed to reduce microbial agents on hospital surfaces and to control surgical site infections. Formaldehyde fumigation has long been an accepted method for areas where microbiological cleanliness is required. Fumigation with formaldehyde vapor is the recognized and most commonly used method because it is a cost-effective procedure. However, alternative methods are sought due to safety and efficacy concerns. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide is a dry gaseous method that has been used as a reliable alternative for aseptic processing isolators, and more recently, for room/facility decontamination. Hydrogen peroxide and silver in solution and diluted in water is a non-toxic and low cost agent. For example, to fumigate a 1000 ft (~28.32 m ) area, a 20% solution (200 mL of solution in 1000 mL demineralized water) would be sprayed via fogger for 30 minutes. Fogging may be done at a rate of up to 130 mL/minute and the contact time should be at least one hour.\n\nChemicals\n\nAt the heart of this technology is the use of chemicals.  Ideally, these chemicals kill or passivate the targeted creatures without harming others.  Usually such a feat is impossible, so fumigation is conducted in the absence of humans.\n\nDiscontinued or rarely used\n\nMany chemicals have been discontinued owing to safety issues.\n\nSafety\n\nFumigation is a hazardous operation. Generally it is a legal requirement that the operator who carries out the fumigation operation holds official certification to perform the fumigation, as the chemicals used are toxic to most forms of life, including humans.\n\nPost operation ventilation of the area is a critical safety aspect of fumigation. It is important to distinguish between the pack or source of the fumigant gas and the environment which has been fumigated. While the fumigant pack may be safe and spent, the space will still hold the fumigant gas until it has been ventilated.\n\nEarly publication"}

A frequent participant in the media, he is also an entrepreneur.\n\nBiography\n\nNicolas Bouzou is a graduate of Paris Dauphine University and Sciences Po with a Master's in Finance.\n\nHis work focuses on economic growth, economic policy, territorial organization and health. He is the research director and a lecturer in the Master 2 and MBA Business Law and Management-Management at the School of Law and Management at the Panth\u00e9on-Assas University .\n\nIn 2006, he founded the consulting firm Aster\u00e8s which publishes economic studies for public actors and companies.\n\nHe is vice-president of the cercle Turgot, which brings together liberal leaders of major companies and political leaders. He was also a member of the Conseil d'Analyse Sociale (2010-2011). In 2017, he was appointed Chief Economist of the Franco-German Committee for Cultural and Creative Industries.\n\nIn 2018, Nicolas Bouzou becomes President of the \"Rencontres de l\u2019avenir\" , a think tank organized in partnership with the city of Saint-Rapha\u00ebl . The 2019 edition of the Rencontres de l\u2019avenir brought together some 30 speakers and more than 10,000 participants during three days of conferences.\n\nNicolas Bouzou has published numerous works, some of which were written collaboratively. \nHis book, co-authored with Julia de Fun\u00e8s, La Com\u00e9die (In)humaine , has sold more than 50,000 copies.\n\nIn his latest publication L\u2019amour augment\u00e9 , Nicolas Bouzou discusses the issues of fidelity and infidelity with couples, the role of dating sites and the changing place of marriage and sex in society. In this book, Nicolas Bouzou particularly defends medically assisted procreation (MAP) and ethical surrogacy as well as homosexual marriage .\n\nPositions\n\nIn 2017, he published Le travail est l\u2019avenir de l\u2019homme ,  within which he discusses the fear of unemployment induced by the arrival of robots and artificial intelligence. For Nicolas Bouzou, this is an unavoidable fear, which was already present, for example, at the beginning of the 19th century, when British textile workers destroyed looms. According to him, labor will not disappear, it will mutate. He states:\n\n\u201cThe most robotized countries, such as Denmark, Germany and South Korea, are also the closest to achieving full employment.\u201d\n\nIn Septembre 2017, he approved President Emmanuel Macron \u2019s policy, notably with the reform of the French labor code, which, according to him, will be able to reduce mass unemployment if it is associated with a very significant effort in terms of vocational training: \u201cThere is no point in allowing companies to create jobs if people are not able to occupy them.\u201d He also supports the government's pension reforms: \u201cIt is clear that [the reform] is redistributive: the losers are the high income earners, the winners are the precarious ones. It\u2019s a left-wing reform! But to say that, you have to know how to read and be honest.\u201d\n\nIn June 2019, he stated that the hospitals of the future \u201cwill need to be run by bold entrepreneurs, rather than prudent managers.\u201d He also predicts the same year that \u201cin 2019, we will suffer a violent stock market crash. It\u2019s almost certain, the probability is close to 100%.\u201d\n\nHe advocates for the reduction of public spending, the number of civil servants, and taxes for businesses and the wealthy. In particular, he suggests abolishing the solidarity tax on wealth and increasing very significantly the IRPP [Personal Income Tax] deductions linked to investments in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nIn 2022, it was revealed that Nicolas Bouzou was paid 10 000 eur to produce a report supporting Uber 's expansion in France , in 2016.\n\nMedia presence\n\nNicolas Bouzou is a regular contributor to Le Figaro , Les \u00c9chos , the Financial Times (UK) and Le Temps (Geneva) (3). He is an editorial writer for L'Express for which he publishes a weekly column.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2013, he appeared in Canal+'s La Matinale with Ma\u00eftena Biraben and Ariane Massenet . Between 2013 and 2014, he intervened in Team Toussaint with Bruce Toussaint .\n\nHe regularly appears in the programs C dans l'air on France 5 , 28 minutes on Arte, / 24H Pujadas LCI, L'Info du vrai on Canal+, 19H Ruth Elkrief on BFMTV, Les d\u00e9codeurs de l'\u00e9co on BFM Business, on Radio Classique in Accords / d\u00e9saccords (18) with Guillaume Durand .\n\nFor Le Figaro , Nicolas Bouzou is part of \u201cthis handful of guest economists\u201d on TV \u201cfor a few years now\u201d \u201cwhenever we are looking for an expert. For the clarity with which he expresses his arguments, his ease in simplifying even the most complicated subjects.\u201d\n\nPublications"}
