{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_Go_for_Tonight", "content": "\" Let Go for Tonight \" is a song by English singer and songwriter Foxes from her debut studio album, Glorious (2014). The song was released as a digital download in the United Kingdom on 23 February 2014 as the album's second single. It entered the UK Singles Chart at number 7. The song stayed in the UK Singles Charts for 10 weeks.\n\nBackground\n\n\"Let Go for Tonight\" was originally supposed to be on Foxes's extended play Warrior (2012), but was later revamped for her debut studio album Glorious (2014).\n\nMusic video\n\nA music video to accompany the release of \"Let Go for Tonight\" was first released onto YouTube on 5 January 2014 at a total length of 3 minutes and 53 seconds. The music video starts out with Foxes and several other people sat in a white room at a white table. The song starts focusing on Foxes, and as the chorus swells, everyone begins throwing various food items and paint. This continues throughout the song, until the last bridge, in which Foxes runs out of the room (revealed to be a three-wall stand set up in a hilly field) and into a hilly field, followed by the others. Foxes ends the song being carried by a man.\n\nAs of November 2019, the song had 25 million views on YouTube.\n\nCritical reception\n\nRobert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a very positive review stating:\n\n\"The original version of Foxes' 'Let Go For Tonight' - which featured on her 'Warrior EP' back in the summer of 2012 - was, along with her previous offering 'Youth', a song that made us really fall for the singer. As such, our natural instinct was to fear the worst when it was announced that she would be releasing a spruced-up version of it as her latest single. But while the new version has undergone a considerable makeover - the stripped down, piano-led production has been given a boost with muscular beats and crashing drums - it has somehow managed to retain the naive and carefree essence of the original. \"Let go for tonight baby, who needs sleep tonight?\" she asks over twinkly synths and strings that take flight on the chorus; the result, an anthemic ode to all-nighters that deserves to rule the world.\"\n\nChart performance\n\nWeekly charts\n\nCertifications\n\nSales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\n\nRelease history"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Midnight", "content": "Permanent Midnight is a 1998 independent drama film written and directed by David Veloz. It stars Ben Stiller , Maria Bello , Elizabeth Hurley , Owen Wilson , Cheryl Ladd and Janeane Garofalo . Based on Jerry Stahl 's autobiographical book of the same name, it depicts Stahl, a successful TV writer for popular series like thirtysomething , Twin Peaks , and ALF , and his struggles with substance abuse .\n\nPermanent Midnight grossed only $1.1 million in limited theatrical release in the United States, but performed better in the home video market. Stiller's performance was critically acclaimed. A soundtrack album for the film was released on September 15, 1998 from DGC Records .\n\nPlot\n\nApproaching the end of a drug rehabilitation program, Jerry Stahl quits his job at a fast food restaurant on an impulse when an attractive woman named Kitty pulls up at the drive-through window. The two check into a motel, where Jerry tells her about his life between bouts of sex. A series of flashbacks, intercut with their conversations, details his working life to this point.\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles from New York City, Jerry, who is already addicted to various prescription medications, becomes friends with fellow addict Nicky. At the urging of Nicky and his girlfriend Vola, Jerry marries Vola's friend Sandra so she can get her green card . Sandra uses her position at a television studio to get Jerry onto the writing staff of the popular comedy series Mr. Chompers .  He uses memories from his childhood, including his mother's hysterical grief over his father's death, to fuel his writing.\n\nHe juggles his Mr. Chompers job and regular visits to a heroin dealer, Dita. However, his drug use eventually gets him fired. Sandra finds him a new job with a different series, No Such Luck , whose star Pamela Verlaine\u2013herself a recovering addict\u2013sternly but sympathetically insists that he kick his habit first.\n\nAs soon as Jerry starts on a methadone program, he runs across a dealer named Gus, who introduces him to crack cocaine and later Dilaudid . His increased drug use costs him his new job, and Sandra throws him out, disgusted at his decision to shoot up when she tells him she is pregnant. Her opinion of him falls even further when he shows up high for the birth of his daughter Nina.\n\nWhile looking after Nina one night, he gets high and is arrested by the police. The incident causes him to lose custody of Nina; Sandra allows him to visit, but their relationship remains badly strained.\n\nThe flashbacks end at this point, with Jerry returning to Los Angeles in hopes of being part of Nina's life. As he begins to resurrect his stalled writing career, he gets a surprise visit from Kitty. The two have one last sexual encounter before she leaves to move to Anchorage .\n\nIn the final scene, Jerry appears on a series of talk shows and news programs, while commenting in voice-over about the damage that his addiction has done to his life. \"I got out with a bad liver and enough debt to keep me in hock 'til I'm 90, if I'm still here. And with my luck, I will be.\"\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nDavid Duchovny was originally cast as Stahl, but left the project to do Playing God . It took nine months to secure financing for the film; it was eventually produced and distributed by Artisan Entertainment .\n\nTo perfect the role of a heroin addict, Ben Stiller worked closely with Stahl himself and learned about heroin use. Stiller also lost 30 pounds through a liquid diet.\n\nThe Mr. Chompers show of the film is based on the TV series ALF .\n\nReception\n\nRelease\n\nPermanent Midnight premiered on September 12, 1998 at the Toronto Film Festival . It was given a limited theatrical release in the United States beginning on September 18. Its worldwide gross was $1,171,001.\n\nCritical response\n\nPermanent Midnight holds a 59% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 54 reviews. Its consensus states: \"Aimless storytelling undermines the gripping, unsettling subject of this film.\"\n\nThough response to the film was mixed, critics praised Ben Stiller's against- type performance and the film's dark humor . Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post wrote, \"As Stahl, Stiller turns in what could easily be the finest performance of a career that, up to now, was devoted mostly to playing an interesting but lightweight assortment of dweebs...this arresting performance, which lurches from buzzing mania to nodding stupor, from glib lies to tongue-tied inarticulateness, is a breakthrough for the talented actor.\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times added, \"Though ' Permanent Midnight ' can\u2019t be classified as fun, Stiller\u2019s comic energy and timing are essential in providing the film with the numerous bleak laughs that become its trademark.\"\n\nIn a three-star review, Roger Ebert wrote, \"The movie gets credit for not making the high life seem colorful or funny. It is not. It is boring, because when the drugs are there they simply clear the pain and allow the mind to focus on getting more drugs. Stahl doesn't seek drugs because he wants to feel good but because he wants to stop feeling bad. It isn't the high that makes people into addicts; it's the withdrawal.\""}
