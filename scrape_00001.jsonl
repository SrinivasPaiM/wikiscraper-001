The series followed the self-titled character, portrayed by Louis Dunn, as he negotiates secondary school and issues at home, along with being a talented footballer. A spin-off series, Jamie Johnson FC , set in the world of elite academy football, was released in 2023.\n\nThe show features several cameo appearances from footballers past and present, including Gary Lineker , Steph Houghton , Raheem Sterling , Luis Su\u00e1rez and Vincent Kompany .\n\nSynopsis\n\nJamie Johnson is a seriously gifted footballer capable of going all the way. But after his dad walks out on them, Jamie and his mother are forced to move in with Jamie's grandfather, meaning Jamie has to start at a new school. He makes friends with Jack and Boggy but makes an enemy of Dillon and struggles to impress football coach, Mr Hansard.\n\nThe series has had many very special episodes , covering topics such as bullying , sexism , cheating , blackmail , relationships , diabetes , homelessness , multiple sclerosis , racism , crime and homophobia .\n\nThe plot is very loosely based on the storyline in the book series of the same name, written author by Dan Freedman, using some of the characters in the books.\n\nCast and characters\n\nEpisodes\n\nSeries 1 (2016)\n\nIn the series Jeremy is played by Jonathan Race and Jack Marshall is played by Olivia Lava.

Ian Reacher is played by Santiago Mosquera for only this series.\n\nJamie has to start at a new school mid-term. With his amazing football talent, Jamie should have no problem fitting in with the cool kids. But new friend, Jack, is disgusted when she witnesses Jamie being cruel to the geeky Boggy. Jamie eventually makes amends, but in the process makes a serious enemy in school bully Dillon. When the horrified Jamie witnesses his mother getting close to a colleague, it makes him all the more determined to track down his dad.\n\nSeries 2 (2017)\n\nIn this series, Jeremy is played by William Andrews now and Jack Marshall is now played by Lenna Gunning Williams due to the two previous actors being unable and/or unwilling to return to the programme. Ian Reacher is now played by William Fox in his first actual appearance.\n\nJamie is on a high - the video of him scoring against Tibbs has gone viral and he is the hero of Kingsmount. But all this attention goes to Jamie\u2019s head when he forces the team to let him take a penalty and then misses it when he dares to do a Panenka. To make matters worse, it is Harry that eventually secures Kingsmount the match. After the game, Harry winds him up and Jamie quickly turns it into a fight.\n\nIt is Dillon\u2019s first try-out at Hawkstone Academy and Jack is sent along to cover it for the school blog.

He is determined to keep focused, but suddenly he seems to have distractions from all sides - not least the arrival of the son of Hawkstone\u2019s latest international signing. But just as things are going well at home too - with him finally getting on with his mother\u2019s boyfriend, Jeremy - there's a knock at the door.\n\nJack is desperate to play in midfield but has to work twice as hard as anyone else to prove her worth to Hansard and is furious when it seems that Hansard is playing an international football\u2019s son, Michel Bernard, ahead of her. Jack vents her frustration at the team, but could this knock to morale cost them the semi-final? And what is Hawkstone Academy bully Jethro doing in the crowd?\n\nReeling from their semi-final defeat, the team are rallied when it seems Boggy might have unearthed some good news. Jack is still not being honest with Jamie about spending time with Michel. When he sees them together at a Hawkstone match, he feels betrayed - but Michel\u2019s days at Kingsmount may be numbered. Jethro threatens Dillon; does he have no choice but to betray his teammates?\n\nKingsmount are through to the cup final at St. George\u2019s Park, the home of the England National Team and the pressure is immense.

But when he fails to make it to the Kingsmount game before kick-off, Hansard is forced to change his game plan. Has Jamie\u2019s ego just cost everyone dearly?\n\nIndira is quick to spread gossip about Jamie\u2019s dad, but when Boggy\u2019s investigations throw doubt on Indira\u2019s assumptions, she is left with a surprising dilemma. Has she got what it takes to be a true friend?\n\nThings go from bad to worse as Jamie turns his back on his friends to hang out with Jethro.

Could Boggy be right that Jamie\u2019s actions are a deliberate ploy to get himself kicked out of Foxborough?\n\nJack and Zoe go head to head for a place at Archfield Women\u2019s Academy, whilst Jamie helps Boggy get Phoenix\u2019s sponsor back on board. But when the sponsor makes it clear they are only interested if he is in, Jamie makes a promise he might regret.\n\nIt is time for Jamie to say goodbye to Jack and decide whether he is signing for Premier League Foxborough or staying with grassroots club Phoenix.

He is determined to prove that he has what it takes to lead the Phoenix under-14s to the Gothia Cup. He sets out to impress Molly, but he goes about it in completely the wrong way, despite a trust exercise which Molly makes the team do, in training he once again plays selfishly, which alienates his teammates. Then Wozza turns up late and announces that he is quitting the team. Jamie lays into him. This leads Molly to give Jamie a major dressing down. Being captain is not just about what you do on the pitch, it is everything else off the pitch as well, respecting your teammates and setting an example.

Matches filmed for the show were mostly real contests, with the actors from the show competing in the tournament. Phoenix FC won six matches in four days, scored 25 goals, conceded just seven, and reached the quarter-finals out of 195 teams, with a squad of just twelve. The team arrived in Sweden having never played a competitive game before and having never previously met some of the cast.\n\nPhoenix FC's run at the tournament was documented in the series four episode The Real Gothia Cup , with Louis Dunn, Lenna Gunning Williams, Patrick Ward, Maddie Murchinson, Jermaine Johnson and Ellie Botterill sharing their memories of the fairytale run.\n\nProduction\n\nCast members were hired for places on the team from both acting and local schools. Many episodes of the series feature cameos from current and former professional footballers specifically for the show, due to the series being produced by the BBC. Since series four, the production has taken place in Wales.\n\nConception\n\nThe plot is loosely based on the series of books by Dan Freedman about a schoolboy footballer experiencing family issues and playing for the school team. In 2011, the book Born to Play was published as a prequel to the series, establishing the title character, Jamie Johnson, and his estranged parents."}
