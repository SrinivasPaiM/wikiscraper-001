{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_and_New_Religious_Movements", "content": "Violence and New Religious Movements is a 2011 edited volume . It was edited by sociologist James R. Lewis and published by Oxford University Press . Lewis' previous work had focused on new religious movements, and he had edited several books on the topic. Containing 19 articles by 22 academics, mostly sociologists or scholars in religious studies , it discusses the intersection between new religious movements and violence, both perpetrated by and against the groups. It is divided into five sections.\n\nThe book covers theoretical approaches to violence and NRMs at large, as well as individual chapters on as what the book classifies as the \"big five\" violent NRMs: the Peoples Temple , the Branch Davidians , the Order of the Solar Temple , Aum Shinrikyo , and Heaven\u2019s Gate . Other sections cover less studied movements associated with violence, like Rodnoverie or Ananda Marga , or groups that had certain commonalities with violent groups but did not actually escalate to large scale violence.\n\nIt received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its coverage of a variety of cases, including less studied and more obscure movements than the typical cases. The content of its individual chapters, as well as its usage of comparative analysis and new insights, was complimented. Its chapter on the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God was singled out for praise by several reviewers.\n\nContents\n\nIn the introduction, Lewis gives a background of his own history with new religious movements ; in the 1970s, he had been a member of the 3HO group, from which he eventually defected. He notes that many internal aspects of this organization were those deemed by analysts to be \"essential\" for a NRM to become violent \u2013 a millenarian outlook, charismatic leader, and totalistic social structure \u2013 however, the group did not become violent. Lewis focuses on how the typical criteria for analyzing which cults may or may not become violent are inadequate, and how several high profile acts of violence related to NRMs in the 1990s affected the field and the theories as to what makes groups result to violence. He says that given the \"relatively mature state of the literature\", different discussions and analyses could now be had on the topic, including discussions of other groups than the \"big five\" and more specific types of violence, or violence against NRMs. He then summarizes the content of the five parts and their chapters.\n\nThe first part, \"Theorizing NRM Violence\", contains what Lewis describes as \"general theory\" chapters. Bromley explores the connection between NRMs and violence, continuing the theory of \"dramatic denouements\" he had explored in Cults, Religion and Violence ; the theory of dramatic denouements is a four stage process of conflict amplification, which Bromley argues NRMs are often predisposed to due to common radical elements. James T. Richardson analyzes NRM violence through a lens of conflict orientation and a presupposed context of violence regarding the groups from the dominant culture. Dick Anthony , Thomas Robbins , and Steven Barrie-Anthony discuss the conflict between new religious movements and the anti-cult movement, viewing it through the lens of Erik Erikson and Robert Jay Lifton 's treatment of totalism; they argue that responding to group totalism with state totalism only fuels the fire.\n\nFollowing this, \"The \"Big Five\" (Plus One)\" covers the \"big five\" violent NRMs \u2013 the Peoples Temple , the Branch Davidians , the Order of the Solar Temple , Aum Shinrikyo , and Heaven\u2019s Gate \u2013 the main groups that have been subject of scholarly discussion when it comes to the intersection of NRMs and violence, as well as the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God , a lesser known group which is sometimes considered along with the others. Rebecca Moore covers the Jonestown mass murder-suicides, giving a brief history of the group, before focusing primarily on the violence within the organization and the message they had intended through their act. Stuart A. Wright critiques the argument of the scholar Kenneth C. G. Newport about the Branch Davidians, who has argued that the group had committed mass suicide; Wright critiques the evidence he presented, further arguing that the whole debate is inextricably tied to political circumstances of the time, and a \"Rorschach test for social actors\", which tells one more about their views than the group itself. Bogdan surveys the varying hypotheses as to what led to the murder-suicides of the Solar Temple, a French-speaking organization less studied by the academic community than the other \"big five\", but that was the deadliest of them. Bogdan analyzes their status as a western esoteric group, and notes the criticism of the comparative analytical approach and an over-reliance on millennialism .\n\nFollowing this, Martin Repp discusses Aum, following the internal history of the group in the context of the wider social environment of Japan. He agures that the term \"religious violence\" should be used cautiously, and that religious justifications were after the fact; the group's actions were best understood similar to other kinds of violence. Benjamin E. Zeller discusses Heaven's Gate, tracing the group's history and highlighting the contradiction between their earlier theology and their eventual mass suicide, arguing that in a \"euphemization of violence\" they had transformed the idea of suicide internally within the group. Finally, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mayer , one of only a few westerners to directly investigate the case, presents his investigation into the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God; his theory, one he acknowledges is among many, is that they wanted fame and media recognition. \"Select Religious Groups Involved in Violence\" profiles other, less known groups that have committed violent acts. Peste discusses the Knutby murder in a small Swedish Pentecostal community, which he compares to NRM violence, though note its lack of one strong leader. Aitamurto discusses Rodnoverie , a Slavic neo-pagan faith, and its warrior elements, as well as its relation to xenophobia and extremism. Helen Crovetto covers Ananda Marga and its political wing, as well as the mass murder of several of its members and murder by several members, and its relation to the group's ideals of usage of force. E. Burke Rochford Jr. discusses ISKCON and the history of New Vrindaban and its controversies.\n\n\"Rhetorics of Violence and Peaceful Denouements\" follows several NRMs whose actions resulted in discussions over the connection between cults and violence, but which did not actually become violent. The Nation of Islam , an African American Muslim NRM, is discussed by Martha F. Lee, who argues that though radical and controversial it did not engage in religiously motivated violence. Marion S. Goldman follows the violence that occurred in Rajneeshpuram ; she explores Pierre Bourdieu \u2019s cultural theories as it relates to the group and how their class dynamics affected their dynamics. 3HO is covered by Constance Elsberg who discusses the factors relevant to the group that may have prevented violence. Jesper Aagaard Petersen's chapter on Satanism follows up on his earlier works, analyzing the distinction between violent actors that use Satanism as a guise (i.e. neo-nazis, serial killers) and symbolic violence common to Satanist groups. The fifth section, \"Violence Against NRMs\", covers the violence perpetrated against the Falun Gong group and the practice of deprogramming . James T. Richardson and Bryan Edelman discuss the Chinese state's hostility and usage of violence against the Falun Gong NRM. Anson Shupe discusses the controversy over deprogramming, a once common practice of forcible removal of members of NRMs from groups, which he harshly criticizes.\n\nIn an afterword, Lewis argues that violence within NRM groups is the result of a process of polarization, resulting from internal and external factors; however, this model fails to reliably predict such cases. Due to the variability of the NRM groups associated with violence, they must be discussed as a spectrum; Lewis encourages scholars to study more diverse arrays of groups to compensate for this. He disccuses how those tasked with responding to a possibly violent group may best respond to the crisis, and lays out possible directions for research to improve the field.\n\nContributors\n\nPublication\n\nViolence and New Religious Movements was published April 6, 2011 by Oxford University Press . Its editor, James R. Lewis , was an academic whose work focused on new religious movements, and who had edited several books on the topic. At the time of its publication, he was an associate professor at the University of Troms\u00f8 in Norway. Most contributors to the book are American, while the majority of the rest are Scandinavian; most are academics in sociology or religious studies .\n\nReception\n\nJohn Walliss called it an \"excellent collection\", and a \"state of the art survey of the field\", recommending it. Bernard Ineichen writing for the journal Mental Health, Religion & Culture in a review of multiple books, said the cases included in the book \"present a rich stew of idealism, viciousness, petty meanness, and sheer stupidity.\" Asbj\u00f8rn Dyrendal of Numen said it was a \"good mix of new and old\", with the best contributions being of old cases, especially from new angles. Walliss noted difficulties in studying the topic, as given that violent NRM incidents were rare comparative analysis was more difficult than in other fields; he praised the book for partially overcoming this with the inclusion of its last three sections of less studied movements. He said this, along with its inclusion of groups that did not commit violence, widened the debate on the issue, lending itself to better analysis. Former deprogrammer Joseph Szimhart, writing for the International Journal of Cultic Studies , the journal of the anti-cult organization ICSA, called the book \"highly nuanced\" but also \"sketchy\".\n\nIneichen complimented the third chapter by Robbins, Anthony, and Barrie-Anthony and the chapter by Shupe as \"excellent\" in their usage of psychological insights, but said \"much more could be done\". He noted that despite its title, many of the connections of the groups included to violence was \"marginal\". Dyrendal praised Wright's chapter as arguing well, saying his chapter showed a need for interdisciplinary approaches in understanding groups like the Branch Davidians. Dyrendal said he was ambivalent towards the work's discussion on non-physical violence, as it could conflate speech with physical violence, though he said Petersen's analysis of Satanism managed this better than Robbins, Anthony, or Richardson's chapters. A reviewer for the International Journal for the Study of New Religions said the book had a \"clear structure\" and it succeeded in analyzing the \"general; model\" of NRM violence as well as more obscure groups. The reviewer praised it as \"timely\" and \"well-structured\"; comparing it to the 2002 book Cults, Religion and Violence (which she described as the first attempt to analyze the NRM-violence relationship), she said Violence and New Religious Movements succeeded in proposing new insights into this topic.\n\nSzimhart said a prospective reader would come away understanding that \"to understand an NRM, per se, one must view it as a dynamic\". He said Lewis's view of the anti-cult movement, followed by most of the authors in the book, was \"narrow\", but that in his view many other writers in the volume escaped this view; he wished that the book had included scholars such as Janja Lalich , Benjamin Zablocki , and Stephen A. Kent to provide more contrasting voices to the volume. Szimhart argued that Robbins, Anthony, and Barrie-Anthony minimized the responsibility that NRMs had, but that he agreed with their point that law enforcement and anti-cult overreaction in some cases could make things worse, as with the Branch Davidians. He noted the second section as \"enlightening\" in its \"consideration of underlying nuances that cult critics often overlook\". He however extensively criticized Shupe's chapter in specific, arguing that it contained \"provocative use of atrocity tales\" and \"errors in fact\".\n\nMayer's chapter on the \"Plus One\" the MRTC was singled out for praise by several reviewers. Walliss noted that the group had received little study compared to the other groups, and that this was a \"welcome addition to the collection and will hopefully inspire further comparative work.\" Ineichen said he had done an \"admirable job\" in creating a comprehensive account of the group's activities; Dyrendal praised what he viewed as \"good scholarship\" on the part of Mayer in weighing the different arguments as to what occurred with the group, though he said this did not lead Mayer to \"any firm conclusion\", but that his offered conclusion was \"possible and plausible\" but with room for additional research and disagreement."}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_history_of_the_Iberian_Peninsula", "content": "The ancestry of modern Iberians (comprising the Spanish and Portuguese ) is consistent with the geographical situation of the Iberian Peninsula in the South-west corner of Europe , showing characteristics that are  largely typical in Southern and Western Europeans. As is the case for most of the rest of Southern Europe, the principal ancestral origin of modern Iberians are Early European Farmers who arrived during the Neolithic. The large predominance of Y-Chromosome Haplogroup R1b, common throughout Western Europe , is also testimony to a sizeable input from various waves of (predominantly male) Western Steppe Herders that originated in the Pontic-Caspian Steppe during the Bronze Age .\n\nModern Iberians' genetic inheritance largely derives from the pre-Roman inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula who were deeply Romanized after the conquest of the region by the ancient Romans :\n\nThere are also some genetic influences from the Alans and Germanic tribes who arrived after the Roman period, including the Suebi , Hasdingi Vandals , and Visigoths . Due to its position on the Mediterranean Sea , like other Southern European countries, there were also contacts with other Mediterranean peoples such as the Phoenicians , Ancient Greeks and Carthaginians who briefly settled along Iberia's eastern and southern coasts, the Sephardi Jewish community, and Berbers and Arabs arrived during Al-Andalus , all of them leaving some North African and Middle Eastern genetic influences, particularly in the south and west of the Iberian Peninsula . Similar to Sardinia , Iberia was slightly less impacted from the Hellenistic Eastern Mediterranean migrations by its western and southern geographic location, and thus has both lower levels of Eastern Mediterranean and higher ones of African admixture than Italy and Greece , most of which probably arrived to Iberia during historic rather than prehistoric times, especially in the Roman period . Nevertheless over half of both Iberian and Sardinian Iron Age genetic profiles were replaced during the centuries long Punic, Roman Imperial and Islamic dominations, with only the Basques remaining largely unaffected.\n\nPopulation Genetics: Methods and Limitations\n\nThe foremost pioneer of the study of population genetics was Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza . Cavalli-Sforza used classical genetic markers to analyse DNA by proxy. This method studies differences in the frequencies of particular allelic traits, namely polymorphisms from proteins found within human blood (such as the ABO blood groups , Rhesus blood antigens, HLA loci , immunoglobulins , G-6-P-D isoenzymes, among others). Subsequently, his team calculated genetic distances between populations, based on the principle that two populations that share similar frequencies of a trait are more closely related than populations that have more divergent frequencies of the trait.\n\nSince then, population genetics has progressed significantly and studies using direct DNA analysis are now abundant and may use mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ), the non-recombining portion of the Y chromosome ( NRY ) or autosomal DNA. MtDNA and NRY DNA share some similar features which have made them particularly useful in genetic anthropology. These properties include the direct, unaltered inheritance of mtDNA and NRY DNA from mother to offspring and father to son, respectively, without the 'scrambling' effects of genetic recombination . We also presume that these genetic loci are not affected by natural selection and that the major process responsible for changes in base pairs has been mutation (which can be calculated).\n\nWhereas Y-DNA and mtDNA haplogroups represent but a small component of a person's DNA pool, autosomal DNA has the advantage of containing hundreds and thousands of examinable genetic loci, thus giving a more complete picture of genetic composition. Descent relationships can only to be determined on a statistical basis, because autosomal DNA undergoes recombination. A single chromosome can record a history for each gene. Autosomal studies are much more reliable for showing the relationships between existing populations but do not offer the possibilities for unraveling their histories in the same way as mtDNA and NRY DNA studies promise, despite their many complications.\n\nAnalyses of nuclear and ancient DNA\n\nNuclear DNA analysis shows that Spanish and Portuguese populations are most closely related to other populations of western  Europe. There is an axis of significant genetic differentiation along the east\u2013west direction, in contrast to remarkable genetic similarity in the north\u2013south direction. North African admixture, associated with the Islamic conquest , can be dated to the period between c. AD 860\u20131120.\n\nA study published in 2019 using samples of 271 Iberians spanning prehistoric and historic times proposes the following inflexion points in Iberian genomic history:\n\nNorth African influence\n\nA number of studies have focused on ascertaining the genetic impact of historical North African population movements into Iberia on the genetic composition of modern Spanish and Portuguese populations. Initial studies pointed to the Straits of Gibraltar acting more as a genetic barrier than a bridge during prehistorical times, while other studies point to a higher level of recent North African admixture among Iberians than among other European populations, albeit this is as a result of more recent migratory movements, particularly the Moorish invasion of Iberia in the 8th century.\n\nIn terms of autosomal DNA, the most recent study regarding African admixture in Iberian populations was conducted in April 2013 by Botigu\u00e9 et al. using  genome-wide SNP data for over 2000 European, Maghreb, Qatar and Sub-Saharan individuals of which 119 were Spaniards and 117 Portuguese, concluding that Spain and Portugal hold significant levels of North African ancestry. Estimates of shared ancestry averaged from 4% in some places to 12% in the general population; the populations of the Canary Islands yielded from 0% to 96% of shared ancestry with north Africans, although the Canary islands are a Spanish exclave located in the African continent, and thus this output is not representative of the Iberian population; these same results did not exceed 2% in other western or southern European populations. Sub-Saharan African ancestry was detected at less than 1% in Europe, with the exception of the Canary Islands. However, contrary to past autosomal studies and to what is inferred from Y-Chromosome and Mitochondrial Haplotype frequencies (see below), it does not detect significant levels of Sub-Saharan ancestry in any European population outside the Canary Islands. Indeed, a prior 2011 autosomal study by Moorjani et al. found Sub-Saharan ancestry in many parts of southern Europe at ranges of between 1-3%, \"the highest proportion of African ancestry in Europe is in Iberia (Portugal 4.2\u00b10.3% and Spain 1.4\u00b10.3%), consistent with inferences based on mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosomes and the observation by Auton et al. that within Europe, the Southwestern Europeans have the highest haplotype-sharing with North Africans.\"\n\nRecent studies show minor relationships between some Iberian regions and North African populations as a result of the Al-Andalus historical period which in Portugal lasted between the 8th and 12th centuries AD, and in southern Spain continued until the late 15th century AD. Iberia is the European region that has a more prominent presence of haplogroup E3b of the human Y chromosome (E-M81), of haplogroup U (U6) and Haplotype Va, and this may be the result of some original common western Mediterranean population. In Portugal, North African Y-chromosome haplogroups (especially those typically North-West African) are at a frequency of 7.1%. Some studies of mitochondrial DNA also find evidence of the North African haplogroup U6, especially in northern Portugal. Although the frequency of U6 is low (4\u20136%), it was estimated that approximately 27% of the population of northern Portugal had some North African ancestry, as U6 is also not a common lineage in North Africa. According to some studies, the North African and Arab elements in the ancestry of today's Iberians are more than trivial when compared to the basis of pre-Islamic ancestry, and the Strait of Gibraltar seems to function more as a genetic bridge than a barrier.\n\nHowever, a study that has used different genetic markers has reached different conclusions. In an autosomal study by Sp\u00ednola et al. (2005), which analyzed the human leukocyte antigen (HLA genes) (inherent in all ancestors in direct paternal and maternal lineages) in hundreds of individuals from Portugal, showed that the Portuguese population has been influenced by other Europeans and North Africans, via many ancient migrations. According to the authors, the North and the South of Portugal show a greater similarity towards North Africans as opposed to the people of the center of the country, who seem closer to other Europeans, since the North of Portugal seems to have concentrated, certainly due to the pressure of Arab expansion, an ancient genetic pole originating from many North Africans and other Europeans, influences through millennia, while southern Portugal shows a North African genetic influence, probably the result of origins recent from the Amazigh people who accompanied the Arab expansion.\n\nAccording to a study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics in December 2008, 30% of modern Portuguese (23.6% in the north and 36.3% in the south) have DNA that shows they have male Sephardic Jewish ancestry and 14% (11.8 in the North and 16.1% in the South) have Moorish ancestry. Despite the possible alternative sources for lineages attributed to a Sephardic Jewish origin, these proportions were testimony to the importance of religious conversion (voluntary or forced), shown by historical episodes of social and religious intolerance .\n\nIn terms of paternal Y-Chromosome DNA, recent studies coincide in that Iberia has the greatest presence of the typically Northwest African Y-chromosome haplotype marker E-M81 in Europe, with an average of 3%. as well as Haplotype Va. Estimates of Y-Chromosome ancestry vary, with a 2008 study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics using 1140 samples from throughout the Iberian peninsula, giving a proportion of 10.6% North African ancestry to the paternal composite of Iberians. A similar 2009 study of Y-chromosome with 659 samples from Southern Portugal, 680 from Northern Spain, 37 samples from Andalusia, 915 samples from mainland Italy, and 93 samples from Sicily found significantly higher levels of North African male ancestry in Portugal, Spain and Sicily (7.1%, 7.7% and 7.5% respectively) than in peninsular Italy (1.7%).\n\nOther studies  of the Iberian gene-pool have estimated significantly lower levels of North African Ancestry. According to Bosch et al. 2000 \"NW African populations may have contributed 7% of Iberian Y chromosomes\". A wide-ranging study by Cruciani et al. 2007, using 6,501 unrelated Y-chromosome samples from 81 populations  found that: \"Considering both these E-M78 sub-haplogroups (E-V12, E-V22, E-V65) and the E-M81 haplogroup, the contribution of northern African lineages to the entire male gene pool of Iberia (barring Pasiegos), continental Italy and Sicily can be estimated as 5.6 percent, 3.6 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively\". A 2007 study  estimated the contribution of northern African lineages to the entire male gene pool of Iberia as 5.6%.\" In general aspects, according to (Bosch et al. 2007) \"...the origins of the Iberian Y-chromosome pool may be summarized as follows: 5% recent NW African, 78% Upper Paleolithic and later local derivatives (group IX), and 10% Neolithic\" (H58, H71).\n\nMitochondrial DNA studies of 2003, coincide in that the Iberian Peninsula holds higher levels of typically North African Haplotype U6, as well as higher frequencies of Sub-Saharan African Haplogroup L in Portugal. High frequencies are largely concentrated in the south and southwest of the Iberian peninsula, therefore overall frequency is higher in Portugal (7.8%) than in Spain (1.9%) with a mean frequency for the entire peninsula of 3.8%. There is considerable geographic divergence across the peninsula with high frequencies observed for Western Andalusia (14.6%) and C\u00f3rdoba (8.3%)., Southern Portugal (10.7%), South West Castile (8%). Adams et al. and other previous publications, propose that the Moorish occupation left a minor Jewish , Saqaliba and some Arab-Berber genetic influence mainly in southern regions of Iberia.\n\nThe most recent and comprehensive genomic studies establish that North African genetic ancestry can be identified throughout most of the Iberian Peninsula , ranging from 0% to 12%, but is highest in the south and west, while being absent or almost absent in the Basque Country and northeast. Hernandez et al. (2020) identified 11.17\u2009\u00b1\u20091.87% North African ancestry in southern Portuguese samples (from a population similar to modern northern Moroccans and Algerians), 9.28\u2009\u00b1\u20091.79% of such ancestry in western Andalusians, and an average of 1.41\u2009\u00b1\u20090.72% sub-Saharan ancestry in southern Iberians (using Yoruba as a proxy source). Lazarids et al. (2014) detected 12.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092% North African ancestry and an average of 1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2% sub-Saharan ancestry in the Spanish population.\n\nCurrent debates revolve around whether U6 presence is due to Islamic expansion into the Iberian peninsula or prior population movements and whether Haplogroup L is linked to the slave trade or prior population movements linked to Islamic expansion. A majority of Haplogroup L lineages in Iberia being North African in origin points to the latter. In 2015,  Hern\u00e1ndez et al.  concluded that \"the estimated entrance of the North African U6 lineages into Iberia at 10 ky correlates well with other L African clades, indicating that some U6 and L lineages moved together from Africa to Iberia in the Early Holocene while a majority were introduced during historic times.\"\n\nHaplogroups\n\nY-Chromosome haplogroups\n\nLike other Western Europeans, among Spaniards and Portuguese the Y-DNA Haplogroup R1b is the most frequent, occurring at over 70% throughout most of Spain. R1b is particularly dominant in the Basque Country and Catalonia, occurring at rate of over 80%.  In Iberia, most men with R1b belong to the subclade R-P312 (R1b1a1a2a1a2; as of 2017). The distribution of haplogroups other than R1b varies widely from one region to another.\n\nIn Portugal as a whole the R1b haplogroups rate 70%, with some areas in the Northwest regions reaching over 90%.\n\nAlthough R1b prevails in much of Western Europe, a key difference is found in the  prevalence in Iberia of R-DF27 (R1b1a1a2a1a2a). This subclade is found in over 60% of the male population in the Basque Country and 40-48% in Madrid, Alicante, Barcelona, Cantabria, Andalucia, Asturias and Galicia. R-DF27 constitutes much more than the half of the total R1b in the Iberian Peninsula. Subsequent in-migration by members of other haplogroups and subclades of R1b did not affect its overall prevalence, although this falls to only two thirds of the total R1b in Valencia and the coast more generally. R-DF27 is also a significant subclade of R1b in parts of France and Britain. R-S28/R-U152 (R1b1a1a2a1a2b) is the prevailing subclade of R1b in Northern Italy, Switzerland and parts of France, but it represents less than 5.0% of the male population in Iberia. Ancient samples from the central European Bell Beaker culture , Hallstatt culture and Tumulus culture belonged to this subclade. R-S28/R-U152 is slightly significant in Seville , Barcelona , Portugal and Basque Country at 10-20% of the total population, but it is represented at frequencies of only 3.0% in Cantabria and Santander , 2.0% in Castille and Leon , 6% in Valencia , and under 1% in Andalusia . Sephardic Jews I1 0%\tI2*/I2a 1% I2 0% Haplogroup R 1a 5%\tR1b 13% G 15% Haplogroup J2 2 25% J */J1 22% E-M215 1b1b 9% T 6% Q 2%\n\nHaplogroup J , mostly subclades of Haplogroup J-M172 (J2), is found at levels of over 20% in some regions, while Haplogroup E has a general frequency of about 10% \u2013 albeit with peaks surpassing 30% in certain areas. Overall, E-M78 (E1b1b1a1 in 2017)  and E-M81 (E1b1b1b1a in 2017) both constitute about 4.0% each, with a further 1.0% from Haplogroup E-M123 (E1b1b1b2a1) and 1.0% from unknown subclades of E-M96. (E-M81 is widely considered to represent relatively historical migrations from North Africa).\n\nMitochondrial DNA\n\nThere have been a number of studies about the mitochondrial DNA haplogroups (mtDNA) in Europe. In contrast to Y DNA haplogroups, mtDNA haplogroups did not show as much geographical patterning, but were more evenly ubiquitous. Apart from the outlying Sami , all Europeans are characterized by the predominance of haplogroups H , U and T . The lack of observable geographic structuring of mtDNA may be due to socio-cultural factors, namely patrilocality and a lack of polyandry .\n\nThe subhaplogroups H1 and H3 have been subject to a more detailed study and would be associated to the Magdalenian expansion from Iberia c. 13,000 years ago:\n\nA 2007 European-wide study including Spanish Basques and Valencian Spaniards found Iberian populations to cluster the furthest from other continental groups, implying that Iberia holds the most ancient European ancestry. In this study, the most prominent genetic stratification in Europe was found to run from the north to the south-east, while another important axis of differentiation runs east\u2013west across the continent. It also found, despite the differences, that all Europeans are closely related.\n\nSubregions\n\nSpain\n\nPortugal\n\nExcerpts from the Abstract of a study published in 2015:\n\n\"[...] In the case of Portugal, previous population genetics studies have already revealed the general portrait of HVS-I and HVS-II mitochondrial diversity, becoming now important to update and expand the mitochondrial region analysed. \nAccordingly, a total of 292 complete control region sequences from continental Portugal were obtained, under a stringent experimental design to ensure the quality of data through double sequencing of each target region.* Furthermore, H-specific coding region SNPs were examined to detail haplogroup classification and complete mitogenomes were obtained for all sequences belonging to haplogroups U4 and U5. In general, a typical Western European haplogroup or Atlantic modal haplotype (AMH) composition was found in mainland Portugal, associated to high level of mitochondrial genetic diversity. Within the country, no signs of substructure were detected. The typing of extra coding region SNPs has provided the refinement or confirmation of the previous classification obtained with EMMA tool in 96% of the cases. Finally, it was also possible to enlarge haplogroup U phylogeny with 28 new U4 and U5 mitogenomes.\"\n\nThe AMH reaches the highest frequencies in the Iberian Peninsula, in Great Britain and Ireland. In the Iberian Peninsula it reaches 70% in Portugal as a whole, with more than 90% in NW Portugal and nearly 90% in Galicia (NW Spain), while the highest value is to be found among the Basques (NE Spain).\n\nThe AMH is the most frequently occurring haplotype amongst human males in Atlantic Europe . It is characterized by the following marker alleles :\n\nWorks cited"}
