{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris%E2%80%93Lecar_model", "content": "The Morris\u2013Lecar model is a biological neuron model developed by professors Catherine Morris and Harold Lecar to reproduce the variety of oscillatory behavior in relation to Ca and K conductance in the muscle fiber of the giant barnacle . Morris\u2013Lecar neurons exhibit both class I and class II neuron excitability.\n\nHistory\n\nCatherine Morris (b. 1949) is a Canadian biologist. She won a Commonwealth scholarship to study at Cambridge University , where she earned her PhD in 1977. She became a professor at the University of Ottawa in the early 1980s. As of 2015, she is an emeritus professor at the University of Ottawa. Harold Lecar (18 October 1935 \u2013 4 February 2014) was an American professor of biophysics and neurobiology at the University of California Berkeley . He graduated with his PhD in physics from Columbia University in 1963.\n\nExperimental method\n\nThe Morris\u2013Lecar experiments relied on the voltage clamp method established by Keynes et al. (1973).\n\nLarge specimens of the barnacle Balanus nubilus (Pacific Bio-Marine Laboratories Inc., Venice, California) were used. The barnacle was sawed into lateral halves, and the depressor scutorum rostralis muscles were carefully exposed. Individual fibers were dissected, the incision starting from the tendon. The other end of the muscle was cut close to its attachment on the shell and ligatured. Isolated fibers were either used immediately or kept for up to 30 min in standard artificial seawater (ASW; see below) before use. Experiments were carried out at room temperature of 22 C .\n\nPrincipal assumptions\n\nAmong the principal assumptions are these:\n\nPhysiological description\n\nThe Morris\u2013Lecar model is a two-dimensional system of nonlinear differential equations .  It is considered a simplified model compared to the four-dimensional Hodgkin\u2013Huxley model .\n\nQualitatively, this system of equations describes the complex relationship between membrane potential and the activation of ion channels within the membrane: the potential depends on the activity of the ion channels, and the activity of the ion channels depends on the voltage. As bifurcation parameters are altered, different classes of neuron behavior are exhibited. \u03c4 N is associated with the relative time scales of the firing dynamics, which varies broadly from cell to cell and exhibits significant temperature dependency.\n\nQuantitatively:\n\nwhere\n\nNote that the M ss and N ss equations may also be expressed as M ss = (1 + exp[\u22122( V \u2212 V 1 ) / V 2 ]) and N ss = (1 + exp[\u22122( V \u2212 V 3 ) / V 4 ]) , however most authors prefer the form using the hyperbolic functions.\n\nVariables\n\nParameters and constants\n\nBifurcations\n\nBifurcation in the Morris\u2013Lecar model have been analyzed with the applied current I , as the main bifurcation parameter and \u03c6 , g Ca , V 3 , V 4 as secondary parameters for phase plane analysis."}

She was a Senator in the Senate of Belgium from 1979 until 1999 and a member of the Liberal Reformist Party . She also served as a member of the Parliament of Wallonia and the Minister of Housing and Information Technology in the Government of Wallonia .\n\nEarly life\n\nMayence-Goossens was born on 14 September 1932 in Aarschot . She received a degree in political and diplomatic sciences from the Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain in 1955. She married the lawyer Philippe Mayence, who was a candidate for presidency of the Christian Social Party in the 1970s. The couple had three children. From 1970, she was a member of the Interuniversity Centre for Continuing Education.\n\nShe helped organise service for the 1958 Universal Exhibition. She served as an advisor for the Confederation of Family Organisations in the European Union (COFACE) while working as a chair for the organisation Connaissance et Vie d'Aujourd'hui.\n\nPolitical career\n\nMayence-Goossens was first elected in October 1979, as the district councillor for Charleroi , a position that she held until 1988 and then again from 1995 to 2000.

She was the first woman to hold a ministerial position in Wallonia. While a minister, she passed the legislation which governs the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 wallonne du logement [ fr ] , the local housing association for Wallonia, which was created as part of the constitutional change in August 1980.\n\nWhen the new federal government led by Wilfried Martens and Jean Gol was elected, Mayence-Goossens was appointed as the Secretary of State for Development Cooperation, which was a department attached to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , a position that she held from 1981 to 1983.
