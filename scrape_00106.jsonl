'At Dawn') is a song by the Soviet group Alyans , originally released in 1987. It is the band's most well-known song. The song became a viral hit in 2019 when Oleg Parastaev, the former keyboardist and songwriter for Alyans, uploaded a previously unaired music video to YouTube.\n\nBackground\n\n\"Na zare\" was written by Oleg Parastaev when he was the keyboardist in Alyans. The musicians recorded and mixed the song in four hours at Muslim Magomayev 's studio with sound engineer Igor Zamaraev. \"Na zare\" appeared on the group's 1987 album, Alliance-87 ( Russian : \u00ab\u0410\u043b\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0441-87\u00bb ), originally released as an unofficial cassette tape .

'Rock and around it'), a 1987 teleconference between Moscow and Leningrad.\n\nAnother music video for the song was filmed in 1987, but remained unreleased until 2019, as the musicians had been unsatisfied with the results. Parastaev found the video in his archives and restored it with the help of the original director, Mikhail Makarenkov. Parastaev uploaded the video to his YouTube channel on 5 April 2019. The video received almost half a million views within a day, and YouTube suspended Parastaev's channel for alleged violation of its community guidelines.

The Axel Johnson was to be renamed Regent Sun , and the Annie Johnson was to be renamed Regent Moon . Regency Cruises did not proceed with the conversions, and the ships were sold to Costa Cruises . The third vessel, Margaret Johnson . intended to become Regent Sky , instead was sold to the breakers, with her steering gear and engines used for the refit of the recently purchased Regent Star .\n\nIn 1988, the cruise line purchased the Royal Odyssey from Royal Cruise Line , and renamed it the Regent Sun . In 1989 the line purchased the unfinished hull of Stena Baltica of Stena Lines, with the intent that the ship would become the line's first new build. Completion would be delayed many times, and the ship would only reach 60% completion by the time Regency went bankrupt. By 1992, the line had six ships, adding Regent Spirit and Regent Rainbow to the fleet that year.\n\nIn 1994 the line purchased the former car ferry M/S Canguro Verde , renaming her the Regent Jewel , and invested a significant amount of money for its acquisition and refit.\n\nIn 1995, Regency Cruises arranged to charter the Princess Cruises ship Fair Princess . Regency planned to operate the ship as the Regent Isle for the start of the 1996 cruise season.\n\nBankruptcy\n\nOn October 29, 1995, Regency Cruises announced its shutdown. Warning signs were seen when several sailings were canceled because the line did not receive financing for the purchase of Princess Cruises' Fair Princess in mid-October. Travel agents were also seeing late commissions on bookings, the company's president Ron Santangelo had resigned, and the Regent Rainbow had been arrested in Tampa . A primary contribution to the bankruptcy was the large acquisition and refit investment of $31.4 million in 1994 for the Regent Jewel .\n\nFollowing bankruptcy, half of the ships would go on to sail for other cruise lines, while the Regent Sea , Regent Sun , and Regent Star would never end up returning to service. The under-construction Regent Sky would never be completed, eventually being scrapped in 2012.\n\nFleet"}
