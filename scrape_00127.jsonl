Jones and Harriet M. James. His father was a lawyer and judge who founded the Hennepin County Savings Bank and a mortgage investment firm. Jones attended Minneapolis Public Schools and the University of Minnesota , graduating in 1883 and working in his father's investment firm thereafter. In 1898, Jones was elected to the Minneapolis City Council; he served as the council's president beginning in 1900. When mayor A. A. Ames fled the city in 1902 to avoid prosecution for corruption, Jones became the city's acting mayor and enacted a series of reforms to rein in the liquor, gambling and prostitution businesses which had proliferated under Ames. While he did not stand for re-election in the fall of 1902, he ran again in 1904 and won a second term where he continued his reforms. He was defeated in his bid for re-election in 1906.\n\nJones died in 1926.\n\nElectoral history"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijuana_Policy_Coordination_Committee", "content": "The Marijuana Policy Coordination Committee is a United States federal government interagency committee created during the first Trump Administration , which includes the Drug Enforcement Administration , and is coordinated by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). Some media have called it \"secret anti-cannabis agency\", \"a uniquely Trumpian government body ... launched in secret for reasons the administration won't explain\", and a \"secretly amassed committee of federal agencies from across the government to combat public support for marijuana\".\n\nThe committee's existence was \"previously unknown\" until it was described in an August, 2018 BuzzFeed News investigatory report by Dominic Holden . In a reaction to the journalism for The Hill , the national Drug Policy Alliance called it \"mind-boggling, and underscores this Administration\u2019s ineptitude on drug policy\", and a California cannabis rights advocacy group called it an assembly of \"department-wide prohibitionist cabals\". Federal authorities in Denver contacted by local television news said they hadn't heard of the committee.\n\nPolitical analysis by MassCentral.com said the ONDCP is \"required by statute to 'take such actions as necessary to oppose any attempt to legalize'\" cannabis at the federal level, and would be \"intent on getting Donald Trump to reconsider his support for letting states go their own way in this area\", labeling the effort anti- federalism .\n\nFurther reading\n\nThis Cannabis -related article is a stub .
