{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics", "content": "Celestial mechanics is the branch of astronomy that deals with the motions of objects in outer space . Historically, celestial mechanics applies principles of physics ( classical mechanics ) to astronomical objects, such as stars and planets , to produce ephemeris data.\n\nHistory\n\nModern analytic celestial mechanics started with Isaac Newton 's Principia (1687) . The name celestial mechanics is more recent than that. Newton wrote that the field should be called \"rational mechanics\". The term \"dynamics\" came in a little later with Gottfried Leibniz , and over a century after Newton, Pierre-Simon Laplace introduced the term celestial mechanics . Prior to Kepler , there was little connection between exact, quantitative prediction of planetary positions, using geometrical or numerical techniques, and contemporary discussions of the physical causes of the planets' motion.\n\nLaws of planetary motion\n\nJohannes Kepler as the first to closely integrate the predictive geometrical astronomy, which had been dominant from Ptolemy in the 2nd\u00a0century to Copernicus , with physical concepts to produce a New Astronomy, Based upon Causes, or Celestial Physics in 1609. His work led to the laws of planetary orbits , which he developed using his physical principles and the planetary observations made by Tycho Brahe . Kepler's elliptical model greatly improved the accuracy of predictions of planetary motion, years before Newton developed his law of gravitation in 1686.\n\nNewtonian mechanics and universal gravitation\n\nIsaac Newton is credited with introducing the idea that the motion of objects in the heavens, such as planets , the Sun , and the Moon , and the motion of objects on the ground, like cannon balls and falling apples, could be described by the same set of physical laws . In this sense he unified celestial and terrestrial dynamics. Using his law of gravity , Newton confirmed Kepler's laws for elliptical orbits by deriving them from the gravitational two-body problem , which Newton included in his epochal Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687.\n\nThree-body problem\n\nAfter Newton, Joseph-Louis Lagrange attempted to solve the three-body problem in 1772, analyzed the stability of planetary orbits, and discovered the existence of the Lagrange points . Lagrange also reformulated the principles of classical mechanics , emphasizing energy more than force, and developing a method to use a single polar coordinate equation to describe any orbit, even those that are parabolic and hyperbolic. This is useful for calculating the behaviour of planets and comets and such (parabolic and hyperbolic orbits are conic section extensions of Kepler's elliptical orbits ). More recently, it has also become useful to calculate spacecraft trajectories .\n\nHenri Poincar\u00e9 published two now classical monographs, \"New Methods of Celestial Mechanics\" (1892\u20131899) and \"Lectures on Celestial Mechanics\" (1905\u20131910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). Poincar\u00e9 showed that the three-body problem is not integrable. In other words, the general solution of the three-body problem can not be expressed in terms of algebraic and transcendental functions through unambiguous coordinates and velocities of the bodies. His work in this area was the first major achievement in celestial mechanics since Isaac Newton.\n\nThese monographs include an idea of Poincar\u00e9, which later became the basis for mathematical \" chaos theory \" (see, in particular, the Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem ) and the general theory of dynamical systems . He introduced the important concept of bifurcation points and proved the existence of equilibrium figures such as the non-ellipsoids, including ring-shaped and pear-shaped figures, and their stability. For this discovery, Poincar\u00e9 received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1900).\n\nStandardisation of astronomical tables\n\nSimon Newcomb was a Canadian-American astronomer who revised Peter Andreas Hansen 's table of lunar positions. In 1877, assisted by George William Hill , he recalculated all the major astronomical constants. After 1884 he conceived, with A.M.W. Downing, a plan to resolve much international confusion on the subject. By the time he attended a standardisation conference in Paris , France, in May\u00a01886, the international consensus was that all ephemerides should be based on Newcomb's calculations. A further conference as late as 1950 confirmed Newcomb's constants as the international standard.\n\nAnomalous precession of Mercury\n\nAlbert Einstein explained the anomalous precession of Mercury's perihelion in his 1916 paper The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity . General relativity led astronomers to recognize that Newtonian mechanics did not provide the highest accuracy.\n\nExamples of problems\n\nCelestial motion, without additional forces such as drag forces or the thrust of a rocket , is governed by the reciprocal gravitational acceleration between masses. A generalization is the n -body problem , where a number n of masses are mutually interacting via the gravitational force. Although analytically not integrable in the general case, the integration can be well approximated numerically.\n\nIn the n = 2 {\\displaystyle n=2} case ( two-body problem ) the configuration is much simpler than for n > 2 {\\displaystyle n>2} . In this case, the system is fully integrable and exact solutions can be found.\n\nA further simplification is based on the \"standard assumptions in astrodynamics\", which include that one body, the orbiting body , is much smaller than the other, the central body . This is also often approximately valid.\n\nPerturbation theory\n\nPerturbation theory comprises mathematical methods that are used to find an approximate solution to a problem which cannot be solved exactly. (It is closely related to methods used in numerical analysis , which are ancient .) The earliest use of modern perturbation theory was to deal with the otherwise unsolvable mathematical problems of celestial mechanics: Newton 's solution for the orbit of the Moon , which moves noticeably differently from a simple Keplerian ellipse because of the competing gravitation of the Earth and the Sun .\n\nPerturbation methods start with a simplified form of the original problem, which is carefully chosen to be exactly solvable. In celestial mechanics, this is usually a Keplerian ellipse , which is correct when there are only two gravitating bodies (say, the Earth and the Moon ), or a circular orbit, which is only correct in special cases of two-body motion, but is often close enough for practical use.\n\nThe solved, but simplified problem is then \"perturbed\" to make its time-rate-of-change equations for the object's position closer to the values from the real problem, such as including the gravitational attraction of a third, more distant body (the Sun ). The slight changes that result from the terms in the equations \u2013 which themselves may have been simplified yet again \u2013 are used as corrections to the original solution. Because simplifications are made at every step, the corrections are never perfect, but even one cycle of corrections often provides a remarkably better approximate solution to the real problem.\n\nThere is no requirement to stop at only one cycle of corrections. A partially corrected solution can be re-used as the new starting point for yet another cycle of perturbations and corrections. In principle, for most problems the recycling and refining of prior solutions to obtain a new generation of better solutions could continue indefinitely, to any desired finite degree of accuracy.\n\nThe common difficulty with the method is that the corrections usually progressively make the new solutions very much more complicated, so each cycle is much more difficult to manage than the previous cycle of corrections. Newton is reported to have said, regarding the problem of the Moon 's orbit \"It causeth my head to ache.\"\n\nThis general procedure \u2013 starting with a simplified problem and gradually adding corrections that make the starting point of the corrected problem closer to the real situation \u2013 is a widely used mathematical tool in advanced sciences and engineering. It is the natural extension of the \"guess, check, and fix\" method used anciently with numbers .\n\nReference frame\n\nProblems in celestial mechanics are often posed in simplifying reference frames, such as the synodic reference frame applied to the three-body problem , where the origin coincides with the barycenter of the two larger celestial bodies. Other reference frames for n-body simulations include those that place the origin to follow the center of mass of a body, such as the heliocentric and the geocentric reference frames. The choice of reference frame gives rise to many phenomena, including the retrograde motion of superior planets while on a geocentric reference frame.\n\nOrbital mechanics\n\nOrbital mechanics or astrodynamics is the application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical concerning the motion of rockets , satellites , and other spacecraft . The motion of these objects is usually calculated from Newton's laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation . Astrodynamics is a core discipline within space-mission design and control.\n\nCelestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems under the influence of gravity , including both spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems , planets , moons , and comets . Orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft trajectories , including orbital maneuvers , orbital plane changes, and interplanetary transfers, and is used by mission planners to predict the results of propulsive maneuvers .\n\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\n\nResearch\n\nArtwork\n\nCourse notes\n\nAssociations\n\nSimulations"}
