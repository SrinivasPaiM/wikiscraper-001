It is currently represented by Ann Davies of Plaid Cymru .\n\nIn the Parliamentary Constituencies Order 2023, the name is given as Caerfyrddin (Carmarthen) . Of the twenty-five Welsh constituencies with names in both English and Welsh , Caerfyrddin is the only one where the Welsh name comes first followed by the English name in brackets (in each of the other cases, the opposite is true). Caerfyrddin is the form used by the UK Parliament.\n\nA similar constituency existed between 1918 and 1997 under the name Carmarthen .\n\nBoundaries\n\nUnder the 2023 review, the constituency was defined as being composed of the following wards of the County of Carmarthenshire , as they existed on 1 December 2020:\n\nFollowing a local government boundary review which came into effect in May 2022, the constituency now comprises the following wards of the County of Carmarthenshire from the 2024 general election:\n\nHistory\n\nThe Parliamentary Borough of Carmarthen (made up of Carmarthen town and Llanelli ) existed from 1542 to 1832 alongside the Parliamentary County of Carmarthenshire , each returning one member . Under the Great Reform Act of 1832 , the Borough was expanded to include both Carmarthen town and Llanelli (known as the Carmarthen Boroughs), and the representation of the county was increased to two members. In 1885, Carmarthenshire was split into the two county constituencies of East Carmarthenshire and West Carmarthenshire with one member each.\n\nIn 1918, the borough constituency was abolished (as well as East and West Carmarthenshire ), but the name Carmarthen was transferred to one of the divisions of the county of Carmarthenshire . The new constituency was made up of the whole of the county of Carmarthenshire except for the new Llanelli constituency (the urban area around Llanelli ). Notable towns were Carmarthen itself, Ammanford and Llandeilo .\n\nIn 1997, the Boundary Commission for Wales recommended an extra seat for Dyfed . This led to the seat being split two to one between Carmarthen East & Dinefwr and Carmarthen West & South Pembrokeshire .\n\nThe constituency was re-established as Caerfyrddin as part of the 2023 review of Westminster constituencies and under the June 2023 final proposals of the Boundary Commission for Wales for the 2024 United Kingdom general election .\n\nPolitical history\n\nBecause the seat contained mining areas in the valley of the River Gwendraeth (until the 1980s), much countryside and a high proportion of Welsh speakers, it was fertile territory for the Labour Party , the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru alike. Although the Conservatives never won the seat, they came within 1200 votes of doing so in 1983 .\n\nCarmarthen is notable as the first constituency to elect a Plaid Cymru MP, Gwynfor Evans , at a 1966 by-election . Evans was later involved in one of the closest General Election results ever in February 1974 , when he lost to the Labour candidate by only three votes. The constituency also shot to fame in the following election in October 1974 as the only seat in the country to see its turnout rise on that of February 1974.\n\nMembers of Parliament\n\n1918\u20131997: county constituency\n\nMPs since 2024\n\nCarmarthen East and Dinefwr and Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire prior to 2024.\n\nElections\n\nElections in the 20th century\n\nElections in the 21st century\n\nNotes"}
