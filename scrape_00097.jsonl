{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Lusi", "content": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Lusi was the second severe tropical cyclone of the 2013\u201314 season and affected Fiji , Vanuatu and New Zealand .\n\nThe system that was to become Cyclone Lusi was first noted as a tropical disturbance on 7 March, while it was located to the east of Fiji. Over the next three days the system moved towards the north-northeast and gradually developed further, before it was named Lusi, late on 9 March, after it had developed into a tropical cyclone. The system dissipated on 17 March.\n\nMeteorological history\n\nEarly on 7 March 2014, the Fiji Meteorological Service reported that Tropical Disturbance 18F had developed about 685\u00a0km (425\u00a0mi) to the west of Nadi. The system was located within a marginally favourable environment for further development, which included low to moderate vertical wind shear and favourable sea surface temperatures . Over the next two days the system moved towards the north-northwest and slowly consolidated, as atmospheric convection wrapped into the system's low level circulation centre , before RSMC Nadi reported during 9 March that the system had developed into a tropical depression. During that day the system further consolidated as it affected Vanuatu and moved towards the north-northeast, before the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated warnings and designated the depression as Tropical Cyclone 18P later that day. RSMC Nadi subsequently named the system Lusi at around 23:00\u00a0UTC (11:00\u00a0FST), after it had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale .\n\nPreparations and impact\n\nVanuatu\n\nLate on 9 March, ahead of the depression being classified as a tropical cyclone and named Lusi, the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-Hazards Department issued tropical cyclone warnings for the Vanuatu provinces of Torba , Sanma , Penama and Malampa .\n\nThe cyclone killed 10 people and impacted as many as 20,000 people, especially in Torba, Sanma, Penama, Malampa and Shefa Provinces . Many low-lying areas were flooded and more than 40 structures were damaged or destroyed. All provinces of the country reported damage to agriculture.\n\nFiji\n\nOn 11 March, a tropical cyclone alert was issued for parts of the Western Division, as Lusi approached the islands from the west. During the next day gale warnings were issued for the Western Division before they were cancelled later that day, as the system turned towards the south sooner than had been expected. As a result, Fiji was spared any direct effects from the cyclone, while the associated trough of low pressure affected the islands until 13 March.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nDuring 9 March, MetService started to warn that a tropical weather system might affect New Zealand by the end of that week.\n\nCyclone Lusi hit New Zealand shores on 13 March. In preparation for the event the New Zealand government advised people to fix loosened things (such as trampolines ), and the Civil Defense team was put on alert. Winds reaching up to 130\u00a0km/h were expected to occur in the cities of Auckland , Whang\u0101rei and Hamilton , and the east coast of the North Island was put on high alert. Lusi brought severe winds as it moved southeast towards Wellington and the northern South Island in the evening of 15 March. On 16 March, the severe gale winds slightly weakened, and Lusi pushed away from New Zealand on 17 March.\n\nInsured losses across the country amounted to NZ$4\u00a0million (US$3\u00a0million).\n\nRetirement\n\nDue to the impacts caused by the storm, the name Lusi was retired and was later replaced by Louise ."}
