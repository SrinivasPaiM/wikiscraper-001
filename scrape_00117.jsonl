It is located with a cluster of interferon inducible genes but is itself not interferon inducible. The gene is 1,327 bases in length and encodes a protein of 132 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 14378 daltons. Expression in adults is bone specific and highest in osteoblasts .\n\nThe homolog in the mouse is located on chromosome 7. A homolog is also known to be present in lizards .\n\nEvolution\n\nThe gene first appeared in bony fish and its bone specific expression appears to be limited to therian mammals .\n\nBiochemistry\n\nThe protein has two transmembrane domains. It associates with FK506 binding protein 11.\n\nClinical\n\nMutations in the gene are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta type 5."}

He served briefly as Justiciar of England in 1260 and as Constable of the Tower of London .\n\nDespenser first played an important part in 1258, when he was prominent on the baronial side in the Mad Parliament of Oxford. In 1260 the barons chose him to succeed Hugh Bigod as Justiciar, and in 1263 the king was further compelled to put the Tower of London in his hands.\n\nHe was the son of Hugh le Despenser and was summoned to Parliament by Simon de Montfort. Hugh was summoned as Baron le Despenser on 14 December 1264 and was Chief Justiciar of England and a leader of the baronial party, so he might be deemed a baron, though the legality of that assembly is doubtful. He remained allied with Montfort to the end, and was present at the Battle of Lewes . He was killed fighting on de Montfort's side at the Battle of Evesham in August 1265. He was slain by Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Wigmore ; this caused a feud to begin between the Despenser and Mortimer families.\n\nBy his wife, Aline Basset, he was father of Hugh Despenser 'the elder' , who became an advisor to Edward II and was made Earl of Winchester . Aline was the daughter of Philip Basset , who had also served as Justiciar. They also had a daughter named Eleanor le Despenser, who married Sir Hugh de Courtenay , feudal baron of Okehampton .\n\nThis United Kingdom law-related biographical article is a stub .

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugendburg", "content": "A Jugendburg , sometimes referred to in English as a youth castle , is a medieval castle in German-speaking countries that was converted during the 20th century into a public community centre or educational facility for young people. The sponsors of the original youth castles came mainly from the Wandervogel and Pfadfinder movement, or were at least linked to the youth movement .\n\nTerminology\n\nThe term Jugendburg originally referred to the use of castles ( Burgen ) by young people ( Jugend ).\n\nThe difference between Jugendburgen in this historical sense and Jugendburgen in the sense of castles that were used as youth hostels , for example run by the German Youth Hostel Association , is disputed. For example, youth hostels had already emerged in the early 20th century in the wake of the youth movement ( Jugendbewegung ) as accommodation for young men, youth groups and school classes. And as early as 1912 the first German youth hostel was established by Richard Schirrmann at Altena Castle (it was rebuilt from 1906 to 1915) above the town of Altena . During the Nazi era youth castles were used by the Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls , and the term was increasingly associated with Nazi ideology . From 1935 to 1943 there was also a schoolchildren's magazine with the title Deutsche Jugendburg (\"German Youth Castle\"), which was published by the National Socialist Teachers League .\n\nJugendburgen in the youth movement\n\nIn connexion with Jugendburgen one frequently comes across the names Gustav Wyneken, Robert Oelbermann and Karl Oelbermann .\n\nIn 1910, the progressive educationalist, Gustav Wyneken , was the chairman of the Bund f\u00fcr freie Schulgemeinden and publisher of its magazine. He also tried to found a new school or \"Jugendburg\" to serve his progressive educational project based on the concept of upbringing as the \"Formation of People in the Sense of a Worldview\" ( Formung des Menschen im Sinne einer Weltanschauung ). For Wyneken it was about a redefinition of the relationships between teacher and pupil. This was to be based on \"comradeship\" ( Kameradschaft ) and \"leadership\" ( F\u00fchrertum ).\n\nUsing his pedagogical approach, Wyneken influenced the emerging youth movement as an adult from 1912 onwards. Wyneken created the concept of \" youth culture \" in opposition to the perceived subservience of Wilhelmine Germany as well as against school and family. In 1913, he worked to organise the First Free German Youth Day at the Hoher Meissner . Here, too, tensions arose, since Wyneken was a leader figure, a concept rejected by many groups at the youth day. The Freideutsche Jugend network which emerged that day around the Meissner Declaration had an anti-rationalist view point at odds with Wyneken's approach.\n\nFascinated by Wyneken's ideas, the brothers, Robert and Karl Oelbermann, dreamt of the Jugendburg concept after the First World War . Robert Oelbermann is considered to be the founder of the \"Nerother Wandervogel - Federation for the Establishment of the Rhenish Youth Castle\" ( Nerother Wandervogel - Bund zur Errichtung der Rheinischen Jugendburg ). By \"Rhenish Jugendburg\", he meant Waldeck Castle in the Hunsr\u00fcck mountains. The Nerother Wandervogel was founded on 27 March 1921 at Drachenfels Castle at Busenberg in the Wasgau region of southwest Germany.\n\nThe Jugendburgen were mostly used to create an independent place of encounter whilst also preserving valuable historical monuments and giving them a new and meaningful use.\n\nNowadays, the aims of a Jugendburg are unchanged; it is about developing young people away from the perceived restrictions and conventions of society.\n\nAs the numbers of scouts and youth leagues continued to rise, the castles became international meeting places at which camps could be held.\n\nJugendburgen in Germany\n\nJugendburgen in Austria\n\nJugendburgen in Switzerland"}
