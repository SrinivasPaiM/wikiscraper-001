The following year, Marz wrote the DC/Marvel: All Access limited series which was an intercompany crossover between DC and Marvel characters.\n\nWhile writing Green Lantern , Marz wrote the \" Emerald Twilight \" storyline, in which the character of Hal Jordan , stricken with grief, became a mass murderer , leading to the destruction of the Green Lantern Corps , and Kyle Rayner being chosen at random as the last Green Lantern.\n\nMarz's 2000s work includes a number of Top Cow Productions comic books, including Witchblade , which he wrote from issue #80 (Nov. 2004) to issue #150, plus a number of specials and crossover stories featuring the character, such as Witchblade/The Punisher in 2007 and Witchblade/Devi in 2008.

This concept was sparked by an event in a 1994 Green Lantern issue written by Ron Marz, where Kyle Rayner discovers his girlfriend Alexandra DeWitt's fate at the hands of the villain Major Force , who had murdered her and left her body in a refrigerator. Simone's critique aimed to shed light on the broader issue of gender bias and the disposability of female characters within the genre.\n\nIn response, Marz stated: \"To me the real difference is less male-female than main character-supporting character. In most cases, main characters, 'title' characters who support their own books, are male.\u00a0... the supporting characters are the ones who suffer the more permanent and shattering tragedies. And a lot of supporting characters are female.\" He also further explained:\n\nI created her [Alexandra DeWitt] with the intention of having her be murdered at the hands of Major Force. I took a lot of care in building her as a character, because I wanted her to be liked and her death to mean something to the readers. I wanted readers to be horrified at the crime, and to empathize with Kyle's loss. Her death was meant to bring brutal realization to Kyle that being GL [Green Lantern] wasn't fun and games. It was also meant to sever his links with his old life, paving the way for his move to New York. And ultimately I wanted her death to be memorable and illustrate just how truly heinous Major Force was. Thus the fridge.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAs of 2013, Marz lives in Duanesburg, New York .\n\nBibliography\n\nCrossGen\n\nDark Horse Comics\n\nDark Horse Comics / DC Comics\n\nDC Comics\n\nDC Comics / Marvel Comics\n\nDynamite Entertainment\n\nImage Comics\n\nImage Comics / Marvel Comics\n\nMarvel Comics\n\nValiant Comics\n\nVirgin Comics"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Murrell_Owens", "content": "Joan Murrell Owens (June 30, 1933 \u2013 May 25, 2011) was an American educator and marine biologist specializing in corals .  She received degrees in Geology, Fine Art, and Guidance Counseling. She described a new genus, Rhombopsammia , and three new species of button corals , R. niphada , R. squiresi , and Letepsammia franki .\n\nLife and Family\n\nJoan M. Owens was born on June 30th, 1933, in Miami, Florida , to William and Leola Murrell. She was the youngest of their three daughters. In the 1960s Murrell married Frank A. Owens.\n\nJoan Owens died on May 25, 2011. She was survived by her sister, Willette M. Carlton; two daughters, Adrienne Lewis and Angela Owens; and a granddaughter, Chara Johnson.\n\nEducation\n\nWith the support of her parents, Owens became interested in the life of the oceans at young age. In 1950 Owens graduated from Miami's Booker T. Washington High School. She was awarded two scholarships, one from the Pepsi-Cola Company and a Sarah Maloney (Art Scholarship) at Fisk University . She later entered Fisk University but the university did not offer a program in the marine sciences. Thus in 1954 she majored in fine art and received her BFA degree with minors mathematics and psychology.\n\nFor graduate study, Owens entered the University of Michigan with the intention to study commercial art. In 1956 she switched to pursue and later receive a Master of Science degree in guidance counseling with an emphasis on reading therapy. After that, she returned to Washington; to pursue marine biology, with support from her companion Philip Morrison , she entered George Washington University in 1970. George Washington University did not have an undergraduate program in marine science. Thus, she majored in geology and a minor in zoology to compensate. She received her B.S. in geology in 1973 and her M.S. in 1976.\n\nResearch\n\nContinuing work toward her doctorate, she returned to Howard University in Washington D.C. as a professor of geology in 1976. Owens had sickle cell anemia traits, making research limited by her inability to dive for specimens. Instead, she conducted a laboratory project at the Smithsonian Institution using coral samples collected by a British expedition in 1880. Her doctoral research investigated deep-sea button corals . Her dissertation was titled \"Microstructural Changes in the Scleractinian Families Micrabaciidae and Fungiidae and their Taxonomic and Ecologic Implications.\" She received her PhD from George Washington University in 1984.\n\nShe continued her laboratory work at the Smithsonian to classify and study button corals. She began advancing to the rank of associate professor in the department of Geology and Geography at Howard University in 1986. She created the new genus Rhombopsammia and its two species in 1986. In 1994 she added a new species to the genus Letepsammia , naming L. franki for her husband, Frank A. Owens. Both genera are in the family Micrabaciidae .\n\nHobbies and Interests\n\nWith the support of her parents, Owens became interested in the life of the oceans at young age. She aspired to study marine biology professionally, her interest likely spurred from family fishing trips. One of her favorite books was The Silent World by Jacques Cousteau .\n\nTeaching\n\nOwens taught for two years at the University of Michigan's Children's Psychiatric Hospital. She later joined the faculty of Howard University in Washington, D.C. in 1957, there she specialized in teaching remedial English. During the 1960s, she moved to Newton, Massachusetts and designed programs for teaching English to educationally disadvantaged students at the Institute for Services to Education. Later, this work influenced the Upward Bound program of the United States Department of Education .\n\nJoan Owens transferred to the biology department of Howard in 1992 when the department of geology and geography was phased out, and retired from full-time work in 1995.\n\nSelected publications"}
