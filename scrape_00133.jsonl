It was developed in 1938 by Rheinmetall-Borsig AG as a successor to the 3.7 cm Pak 36 , and was in turn followed by the 7.5 cm Pak 40 . The unique curved gun-shield design differed from most WWII anti-tank guns which had either one flat or two angled and one flat gun-shield plates for ease of manufacturing.\n\nDevelopment\n\nAfter the Spanish Civil War , the German authorities started to think that a new anti-tank gun would be needed, even though the 3.7 cm Pak 36 had proven to be very successful. They asked Rheinmetall-Borsig to produce a new and more capable AT-gun. They first designed the Pak 37 in 1935, but the German authorities did not approve it because of its low capabilities. Rheinmetall-Borsig were forced to create a new gun with a longer - L/60 - barrel which was approved for mass production in 1939 under the designation Pak 38.\n\nVariants\n\nThe original tank gun for the Panzer III was the 5 cm KwK 38 , which despite being the same 5\u00a0cm caliber had a lower muzzle velocity due to the shorter barrel length (L/42 calibers) and smaller cartridge. When a more powerful gun with greater penetration was needed for the Panzer III the longer barrel 5 cm KwK 39 gun (L/60 calibers) was developed as a variant of the 5\u00a0cm Pak 38 towed anti-tank gun.\n\nService\n\nThe Pak 38 was first used by the German forces during the Second World War in April 1941. When the Germans faced Soviet tanks in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa starting June 1941, the Pak 38 was one of the few guns capable of penetrating the 45\u00a0mm (1.8\u00a0in) sloped armor of the T-34 medium tank at close range. The gun was also equipped with Panzergranate 40 APCR shots with a hard tungsten carbide core, in an attempt to penetrate the armor of the heavier KV-1 tank.\n\nAlthough it was replaced by more powerful weapons, it remained a useful weapon and remained in service with the Wehrmacht until the end of the war.\n\nThe Pak 38 carriage was also used for the 7.5 cm Pak 97/38 and the 7.5 cm Pak 50 guns.\n\nRomania imported 110 Pak 38s in March 1943. The guns remained in service with the Romanian Armed Forces until 1954, when the 57 mm anti-tank gun M1943 (ZiS-2) replaced them.\n\nPerformance"}

Initially founded under the name Montana Freie Presse , which was changed in 1889. It was the only major German-language newspaper in Montana and neighboring Idaho at the time and its readership primarily consisted of Germans , Austrians , and Swiss residing in the two territories/states. The paper had representatives in Berlin , Vienna , Z\u00fcrich , New York City , and Chicago . The Montana Staats-Zeitung abruptly ceased publication in September 1917, citing rising costs, censorship of German-language material as a consequence of World War I , paper shortages, and the editor's absence (the editor at the time had not returned from Chicago in over five months) as reasons for its demise."}
