{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizar_system", "content": "The Mizar system consists of a formal language for writing mathematical definitions and proofs, a proof assistant , which is able to mechanically check proofs written in this language, and a library of formalized mathematics , which can be used in the proof of new theorems. The system is maintained and developed by the Mizar Project, formerly under the direction of its founder Andrzej Trybulec .\n\nIn 2009 the Mizar Mathematical Library was the largest coherent body of strictly formalized mathematics in existence.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Mizar Project was started around 1973 by Andrzej Trybulec as an attempt to reconstruct mathematical vernacular so it can be checked by a computer. Its current goal, apart from the continual development of the Mizar System, is the collaborative creation of a large library of formally verified proofs, covering most of the core of modern mathematics. This is in line with the influential QED manifesto .\n\nCurrently the project is developed and maintained by research groups at Bia\u0142ystok University , Poland, the University of Alberta , Canada, and Shinshu University , Japan. While the Mizar proof checker remains proprietary, the Mizar Mathematical Library\u2014the sizable body of formalized mathematics that it verified\u2014is licensed open-source.\n\nPapers related to the Mizar system regularly appear in the peer-reviewed journals of the mathematic formalization academic community. These include Studies in Logic, Grammar and Rhetoric , Intelligent Computer Mathematics , Interactive Theorem Proving , Journal of Automated Reasoning and the Journal of Formalized Reasoning .\n\nMizar language\n\nThe distinctive feature of the Mizar language is its readability. As is common in mathematical text, it relies on classical logic and a declarative style . Mizar articles are written in ordinary ASCII , but the language was designed to be close enough to the mathematical vernacular that most mathematicians could read and understand Mizar articles without special training. Yet, the language enables the increased level of formality necessary for automated proof checking .\n\nFor a proof to be admitted, all steps have to be justified either by elementary logical arguments or by citing previously verified proofs. This results in a higher level of rigor and detail than is customary in mathematical textbooks and publications. Thus, a typical Mizar article is about four times as long as an equivalent paper written in ordinary style.\n\nFormalization is relatively labor-intensive, but not impossibly difficult. Once one is versed in the system, it takes about one week of full-time work to have a textbook page formally verified. This suggests that its benefits are now within the reach of applied fields such as probability theory and economics .\n\nMizar Mathematical Library\n\nThe Mizar Mathematical Library (MML) includes all theorems to which authors can refer in newly written articles. Once approved by the proof checker they are further evaluated in a process of peer-review for appropriate contribution and style. If accepted they are published in the associated Journal of Formalized Mathematics and added to the MML.\n\nBreadth\n\nAs of July 2012, the MML included 1150 articles written by 241 authors. In aggregate, these contain more than 10,000 formal definitions of mathematical objects and about 52,000 theorems proved on these objects. More than 180 named mathematical facts have been given formal codification in this manner. Some examples are the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem , K\u0151nig's lemma , the Brouwer fixed point theorem , G\u00f6del's completeness theorem , and the Jordan curve theorem .\n\nThis breadth of coverage has led some to suggest Mizar as one of the leading approximations to the QED utopia of encoding all core mathematics in computer verifiable form.\n\nAvailability\n\nAll MML articles are available in PDF form as the papers of the Journal of Formalized Mathematics . The full text of the MML is distributed with the Mizar checker and can be freely downloaded from the Mizar website. In an ongoing recent project the library was also made available in an experimental wiki form that only admits edits when they are approved by the Mizar checker.\n\nThe MML Query website implements a powerful search engine for the contents of the MML. Among other abilities, it can retrieve all MML theorems proved about any particular type or operator.\n\nLogical structure\n\nThe MML is built on the axioms of the Tarski\u2013Grothendieck set theory . Even though semantically all objects are sets , the language allows one to define and use syntactical weak types . For example, a set may be declared to be of type Nat only when its internal structure conforms with a particular list of requirements. In turn, this list serves as the definition of the natural numbers and the set of all the sets that conform to this list is denoted as NAT . This implementation of types seeks to reflect the way most mathematicians formally think of symbols and so streamline codification.\n\nMizar Proof Checker\n\nDistributions of the Mizar Proof Checker for all major operating systems are freely available for download at the Mizar Project website. Use of the proof checker is free for all non-commercial purposes. It is written in Free Pascal and the source code is available on GitHub."}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Losigkeit", "content": "Spanish Civil War\n\nWorld War II\n\nFritz Losigkeit (17 November 1913\u00a0\u2013 14 January 1994) was a German Luftwaffe military aviator during the Spanish Civil War and wing commander during World War II . As a fighter ace , he is credited with 68 aerial victories in approximately 750 combat missions. This figure includes 13 aerial victories over the Western Allies , the remaining victories were claimed over the Eastern Front .\n\nIn June 1943, he was given command of III. Gruppe , Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG\u00a051\u201451st Fighter Wing) which was fighting on the Eastern Front. In April 1944, Losigkeit was appointed Geschwaderkommodore (wing commander) of JG\u00a051. A year later, he was appointed the last Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG\u00a077\u201477th Fighter Wing) and received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross , the highest award in the military and paramilitary forces of Nazi Germany during World War II.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nLosigkeit was born on 17 November 1913 in Berlin-Tegel and joined the Prussian State Police ( preu\u00dfischen Landespolizei ) in 1934. A year later, he transferred to the Reichswehr as a Fahnenjunker (officer candidate) and was eventually selected for flight training. After graduation, he was assigned to Jagdgeschwader 132 \"Richthofen\" (JG\u00a0132\u2014132nd Fighter Wing) on 1 October 1936. In late January 1938, Losigkeit was invited to an international winter sports event in Garmisch-Partenkirchen . The event was hosted by the Reichssportf\u00fchrer Hans von Tschammer und Osten and bobsledder Werner Zahn who was also a pilot. Other Luftwaffe officers attending this event included G\u00fcnther L\u00fctzow , Walter Oesau , Karl-Heinz Greisert , G\u00fcnter Schultze-Blank and Urban Schlaffer.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War , Losigkeit volunteered for service in the Condor Legion . On 25 March 1938, he was assigned to 3. Staffel (3rd squadron) of Jagdgruppe 88 , at the time headed by Oberleutnant Horst Lehrmann and based at Zaragoza Airfield . On 31 May 1938, during the second mission of the day, Oberleutnant Werner M\u00f6lders led a Schwarm on a ground attack mission. Attacking a truck, Losigkeit was shot down by 20\u00a0mm anti-aircraft guns and taken prisoner of war . He spent eight months in captivity in Valencia and Barcelona before returning to Germany in February 1939. For his actions in Spain, he was awarded the Spanish Cross in Silver with Swords ( Spanienkreuz in Silber mit Schwertern ) on 14 April 1939. Lossigkeit was assigned to 2. Staffel , a squadron of I. Gruppe (1st Group), of Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG\u00a026\u201426th Fighter Wing) on 1 April. At the time, 2. Staffel was commanded by Hauptmann Walter Kienitz while I. Gruppe was headed by Major Gotthard Handrick .\n\nWorld War II\n\nWorld War II in Europe began on Friday 1 September 1939 when German forces invaded Poland. On 23 September 1939, Losigkeit was appointed Staffelkapit\u00e4n (squadron leader) of 2. Staffel of JG\u00a026, replacing Kienitz who was transferred. He claimed his first victory on 28 May 1940 during the Battle of Dunkirk , as part of the Battle of France , over a Royal Air Force (RAF) Supermarine Spitfire between Dover and Ostend . On 1 June, the fighting over the beachhead at Dunkirk continued. In combat with RAF fighters from No. 19 Squadron , No. 222 Squadron and No. 616 Squadron , Losigkeit shot down a Spitfire near Dunkirk, his last during the Battle of France. The Armistice of 22 June 1940 ended the Battle of France and JG\u00a026 began its relocation back to Germany for a period of rest and replenishment. Two days later, Handrick was appointed Geschwaderkommodore (wing commander) of JG\u00a026 while command of I. Gruppe was handed to Hauptmann Kurt Fischer. On 26 June, the Gruppe arrived at B\u00f6nninghardt .\n\nAs the air war turned to England, I. Gruppe was moved to France again on 15 July and subordinated to Luftflotte 2 (Air Fleet 2). Losigkeit claimed his first aerial victory during the Battle of Britain on 28 August. On a bomber escort mission, he shot down a Hawker Hurricane from No. 79 Squadron north of Folkestone . Two days later, on a mission attacking 11 Group airfields, he claimed a Spitfire shot down southeast of Littlestone . On 15 September, on a mission to London , Losigkeit claimed his fifth aerial victory of the war and last during the Battle of Britain. Southeast of London, he claimed a No. 92 Squadron Spitfire destroyed.\n\nOn 17 June 1941, Losigkeit was replaced by Oberleutnant Martin Rysavy as Staffelkapit\u00e4n of 2. Staffel of JG\u00a026. Losigkeit had been transferred to take a position with the staff of the military attach\u00e9 in Japan . Until January 1942 he advised on German air combat tactics with Imperial Japanese Army Air Service pilots flying the Nakajima Ki-44 against several examples of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter shipped to Japan for evaluation. Wanting to rejoin the European war, he made the 23,300 nautical miles (26,800 miles) voyage back to Germany via the German blockade runner MSS Elsa Essberger . In January 1942, Elsa Essberger and the escorting German submarine U-373 came under attack by British aircraft flying from Gibraltar , forcing Elsa Essberger to make for repairs at Ferrol in Spain.\n\nJagdgruppe Losigkeit\n\nFollowing his return from Japan, Losigkeit joined the staff with the General der Jagdflieger (Inspector of Fighters), an office held by Oberst Adolf Galland . Fearing a British invasion of Norway, Adolf Hitler had ordered the Oberkommando der Marine (OKM\u2014German Navy high command) to return the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen from Brest in Brittany to German bases. The Kriegsmarine transferred the ships on 11\u201313 February 1942 in Operation Cerberus , also known as the Channel Dash. Further Kriegsmarine vessels were ordered to Norway to combat the convoys heading to the Soviet Union. To protect these naval units from aerial attacks, Galland instructed Losigkeit with the creation of a fighter unit on 14 February. This unit, dubbed Jagdgruppe Losigkeit (Fighter Group Losigkeit), was made up of three Staffeln . 1. Staffel was created from 8. Staffel of Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG\u00a01\u20131st Fighter Wing) and commanded by Hauptmann Rolf Str\u00f6ssner. 2. Staffel was based on 2. Staffel of JG\u00a01 and led by Hauptmann Werner Dolenga. The Einsatzstaffel of Jagdfliegerschule 1 under Oberleutnant Friedrich Eberle formed 3. Staffel of Jagdgruppe Losigkeit . Losigkeit chose Leutnant Heinz Knoke from 2. Staffel of JG\u00a01 as his adjutant.\n\nOn 15 February, the unit began relocating north, at first to Esbjerg in Denmark. The following day, 3. Staffel reached Aalborg . Weather conditions initially affected the transfer. Jagdgruppe Losigkeit reached the Gardemoen Airfield , approximately 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Oslo , on 20 February and further to Trondheim on 24 February, one day after the Kriegsmarine vessels. At Trondheim, the unit was subordinated to the Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer Norwegen , an office held by Oberst Carl-Alfred Schumacher . On 25 February, Jagdgruppe Losigkeit provided fighter protection for Prinz Eugen , which had been damaged in the Channel Dash. In March, the unit was ordered back to Germany, arriving in Jever on 20 March where it was disbanded. During its existence, Jagdgruppe Losigkeit claimed one aerial victory, a Spitfire flown by Flight Lieutenant Sandy Gunn shot down by Leutnant Dieter Gerhard on 5 March.\n\nWith Jagdgeschwader 1\n\nIn March 1942, IV. Gruppe of JG\u00a01 was re-named III. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 5 (JG\u00a05\u20145th Fighter Wing). In consequence, Losigkeit was charged with the creation of a new IV. Gruppe which was initially based at Werneuchen near Berlin . Oberleutnant Friedrich Eberle headed 10. Staffel which had already served as 3. Staffel of Jagdgruppe Losigkeit . The Einsatzstaffel of Jagdfliegerschule 4 under Oberleutnant Wilhelm Moritz formed 11. Staffel . Oberleutnant Franz Eisenach initially led 12. Staffel created from some pilots of the former IV. Gruppe . Command of 12. Staffel then passed on to Oberleutnant Heinz St\u00f6cker. In late April, Losigkeit reported the combat readiness of IV. Gruppe which then moved to airfields at Leeuwarden and D\u00fcsseldorf on 27 April. IV. Gruppe was withdrawn from combat operations in July 1942 and re-equipped with the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter aircraft.\n\nOn 1 April 1943, I. Gruppe of JG\u00a01 became the II. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 11 (JG\u00a011\u201411th Fighter Wing). In consequence, IV. Gruppe of JG\u00a01 became the new I. Gruppe of JG\u00a01. On 17 April, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) VIII Bomber Command attacked the Focke-Wulf factories at Bremen, causing significant damage. During the attack, Losigkeit shot down a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber. On 2 May, 25 RAF Spitfires escorted 18 Lockheed Ventura bombers which were intercepted by fighters from I. and II. Gruppe of JG\u00a01 east of Vlissingen . For the loss of two Fw\u00a0190s, pilots of JG\u00a01 claimed nine aerial victories, including a Ventura claimed by Losigkeit.\n\nEastern Front\n\nOn 20 May, Losigkeit was transferred upon his own request. He was given command of I. Gruppe of JG\u00a026 on the Eastern Front . The former commander of I. Gruppe of JG\u00a026, Major Johannes Seifert , had been taken off combat duty after his brother was killed in action . Losigkeit had made his request for transfer because of substantial differences with the Jaf\u00fc ( Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer \u2014the commander of the fighter forces) of the 3. Jagd-Division . Apparently the commanding officer of the 3. Jagd-Division , Generalleutnant Werner Junck , had accused the fighter pilots of cowardice in combating the B-17 bombers. On 4 June, he flew his first mission on the Eastern Front, flying a fighter sweep 60 kilometers (37 miles) into Soviet airspace from Shatalovka . On 6 June, I. Gruppe began its return to Germany while Losigkeit remained on the Eastern Front. On 26 June, he took over command of III. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 51 \"M\u00f6lders\" (JG\u00a051\u201451st Fighter Wing) from Hauptmann Herbert Wehnelt who had briefly led the Gruppe after Hauptmann Karl-Heinz Schnell was transferred.\n\nIII. Gruppe was also based Shatalovka, flying combat missions in the vicinity of Mtsensk and Oryol . On 5 July, III. Gruppe began flying missions in support of Operation Citadel , as part of the Battle of Kursk . The Gruppe supported the 9th Army , attacking the salient from the north. That day, Losigkeit claimed two Lavochkin La-5 fighters shot down. The following day, in aerial combat near Maloarkhangelsk , he claimed another La-5 destroyed. Later that day, he was credited with shooting down a Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3 fighter. On 7 July, III. Gruppe again fought in the vicinity of Maloarkhangelsk where they claimed 17 aerial victories, including a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3 by Losigkeit, for the loss of one severely shot up Fw\u00a0190 from 8. Staffel . Losigkeit was awarded the German Cross in Gold ( Deutsches Kreuz in Gold ) on 17 October 1943.\n\nWing commander\n\nOn 1 April 1944, Losigkeit was appointed Geschwaderkommodore of JG\u00a051. He succeeded Oberstleutnant Karl-Gottfried Nordmann who was transferred. Command of III. Gruppe of JG\u00a051 was handed to Hauptmann Diethelm von Eichel-Streiber . The Stab of JG\u00a051 was based at Terespol in the combat area of Army Group Centre . On 21 June, bombers of the Eighth Air Force, formerly VIII Bomber Command, on a shuttle bombing mission of Operation Frantic , attacked oil refineries south of Berlin before heading for the Poltava Air Base . The bombers were intercepted by elements of JG\u00a051 led by Losigkeit. In this encounter, two of the escorting North American P-51 Mustang fighters were shot down. One of the P-51 fighters crashed near the Luftwaffe airfield at Babruysk where III. Gruppe of JG\u00a051 was based. In its cockpit, a map of the Poltava Air Base was found. The commander of III. Gruppe , Eichel-Streiber, sent the map to the headquarters of Luftflotte 6 (6th Air Fleet). This intelligence led to an attack by Luftwaffe bombers which destroyed 44 parked B-17 bombers and damaged further 26.\n\nLosigkeit flew to Danzig-Langfuhr , present-day Wrzeszcz, in a Messerschmitt Bf 108 Taifun in late March 1945 to assist the retreat west. There, he was handed a teleprinter message by Oberst Herbert Ihlefeld that he was ordered to Ostrau , present-day Ostrava, to take command of Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG\u00a077\u201477th Fighter Wing) on 1 April 1945. He succeeded Major Siegfried Freytag in this capacity who had temporarily assumed this office after Oberstleutnant Erich Leie was killed in action on 7 March. That day, he took command of JG\u00a077 at Beneschau , present-day Bene\u0161ov, in the Czech Republic. With the arrival of Losigkeit, Freytag resumed command of II. Gruppe of JG\u00a077. Command of JG\u00a051 was passed on to Major Heinz Lange . Losigkeit was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) on 28 April 1945.\n\nThe Geschwaderstab and II. Gruppe were based at Skutsch (Skute\u010d) on 8 May. Losigkeit ordered the destruction of all remaining aircraft before boarding a Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft, filled up with fuel from salvaged aircraft, heading west to avoid capture by the Red Army.\n\nLater life\n\nAfter the war, Losigkeit was a member of the Gehlen Organization codename \"Lohmann\". In 1953, G\u00fcnter Hof\u00e9, an old friend of Losigkeit and member of the Service de Documentation Ext\u00e9rieure et de Contre-Espionnage ) (French Secret Service), contacted Losigkeit which led to Hof\u00e9 being recruited by the Gehlen Organization. Hof\u00e9 was involved in a counterespionage activity involving Heinz Felfe . Losigkeit died on 14 January 1994 in H\u00fcnxe .\n\nSummary of career\n\nAerial victory claims\n\nAccording to US historian David T. Zabecki , Losigkeit was credited with 68 aerial victories. Obermaier and Spick also list him with 68 aerial victories, including 13 on the Western Front, claimed in approximately 750 combat missions. Mathews and Foreman, authors of Luftwaffe Aces \u2014 Biographies and Victory Claims , researched the German Federal Archives and found records for 51 aerial victory claims. This figure includes 44 aerial victories on the Eastern Front and seven over the Western Allies , including one four-engined bomber.\n\nVictory claims were logged to a map-reference (PQ = Planquadrat ), for example \"PQ 05 Ost S/83/1/5\". The Luftwaffe grid map ( J\u00e4germeldenetz ) covered all of Europe, western Russia and North Africa and was composed of rectangles measuring 15 minutes of latitude by 30 minutes of longitude , an area of about 930 square kilometers (360 square miles). These sectors were then subdivided into 36 smaller units to give a location area 3 by 4 kilometers (1.9 by 2.5 miles) in size.\n\nAwards\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography"}
