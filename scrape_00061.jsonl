{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilly_Devine", "content": "Matilda Mary Devine (n\u00e9e Twiss , 8 September 1900 \u2013 24 November 1970), known as Tilly Devine , was an English Australian organised crime boss. She was involved in a wide range of activities, including sly-grog , razor gangs , and prostitution, and became a famous folk figure in Sydney during the interwar years.\n\nEarly life\n\nDevine was born the daughter of bricklayer Edward Twiss, and Alice Twiss (n\u00e9e Tubb) at 57 Hollington Street, Camberwell , London in the United Kingdom. At 16 she married an Australian serviceman, James (Jim) Edward Joseph  Devine, (born Brunswick, Victoria , 1892, died Heidelberg, Victoria , 18 August 1966), on 12 April 1917 at the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Camberwell, London. The couple had one son, Frederick Ralph Twiss, born in Camberwell, Southwark, London in 1919.\n\nHer career in prostitution began when she was a teenager and continued after she was married. She and many English women were usually found soliciting on the wide footpaths on The Strand, at night. From 1915 onwards to 1919, she spent time at Bow Street Court and Lock Up for prostitution, theft and assault.\n\nWhen Jim returned to Australia she followed him back on the bride ship Waimana , arriving in Sydney on 13 January 1920. Her son stayed in London and was brought up by her parents. Both Tilly and Jim Devine rapidly became prominent illegal narcotics dealers, brothel owners and crime gangs members in the Sydney criminal milieu.\n\nCriminal career\n\nTilly Devine, known as the \u2018Queen of Woolloomooloo\u2019 ran a string of brothels centred around Darlinghurst and the Cross, and in particular, Palmer Street. Kate Leigh , known as the \u2018Queen of Surry Hills\u2019, was a sly grogger and fence for stolen property.\n\nBy 1925 Tilly was well known to police. In five years she had accumulated a long list of convictions; the numerous offences ranged from common prostitution to indecent language, offensive behaviour and assault. The police report is a snapshot of the life that Tilly was leading up to 1925, a life that involved working the streets at night, clashes with Police and lots of parties and heavy drinking.\n\nDevine became infamous in Sydney, initially as a prostitute, then later as a brothel madam and organised crime entrepreneur. The NSW Vagrancy Act 1905 prohibited men from running brothels; it did nothing to stop women with criminal gangs' support and bribes to the police from running criminal enterprises. Historian Larry Writer has noted that the Devines ran diversified operations. Elite \"call girls\" were available for politicians, businessmen and overseas guests of significance, while \"tenement girls\" were young working-class women who resorted to casual prostitution to supplement their drug spending, clothing and meagre earnings during times of Australian criminal and narcotic culture, absence of a comprehensive welfare state and unemployment. Older female prostitutes, \"boat girls\", catered to itinerant sailors or working-class men. Devine does not seem to have run similar operations for the gay sex market during this time because she believed gays went to hell.\n\nDevine's wealth was legendary, although it was all earned from crime. She owned much real estate in Sydney, many luxury cars, looted gold and diamond jewellery and travelled by ship in first class staterooms. Much of her wealth was also used to pay bribes to the police sectors, and fines for her criminal convictions that spanned fifty years. Devine faced numerous court summons and was convicted on 204 occasions during her long criminal career, and served many gaol sentences in New South Wales gaols, mainly for prostitution, violent assault, affray and attempted murder. She was known to the police to be of a violent nature and was known to use firearms.\n\nMarriage to Jim Devine\n\nJames Edward Joseph (Jim) Devine was an WWI ex-serviceman and shearer, who was a violent 'stand-over' man, a convicted thief, a pimp, drug dealer, vicious thug and gunman. He was also an alcoholic. Devine committed a number of high-profile murders in Sydney between 1929 and 1931: notably, the murder of criminal George Leonard \"Gregory\" Gaffney on 17 July 1929, secondly, as an accessory to the murder of Barney Dalton on 9 November 1929 (with infamous Sydney gangster and assassin, Francis Donald \"Frankie\" Green) and, thirdly, the accidental shooting of taxi driver, Frederick Herbert Moffitt on 16 June 1931. Although he was charged with murder on more than one occasion, he was always acquitted, successfully arguing self defence . He shot and killed Gaffney and Moffitt outside his and Tilly's Maroubra residence.\n\nTilly and Jim Devine's marriage was marred by domestic violence. On 9 January 1931, Jim was charged at Central Police Court with the attempted murder of his wife after a heated argument at their Maroubra home. As Tilly ran out of the house, Jim fired a number of shots at her in a similar way to the murder of George Leonard Gaffney in 1929. Tilly escaped unscathed, the only damage being one of her brand new stilettos \u2013 the left one. Their terrified neighbours called the police resulting in Jim being arrested and charged over the incident. He was later acquitted, on 16 January 1931, because Tilly refused to testify. The Devines separated in the early 1940s and were finally divorced in January 1944. Shortly after Tilly separated from Jim, long time criminal associate, Donald Alexander Kenney (1906\u20131963), known as 'Skinny Kenney', became Tilly's lover and stand-over man.\n\nSecond marriage\n\nDevine married for the second time on 19 May 1945 to ex-seaman and returned serviceman Eric John Parsons (born Melbourne 1901, died Sydney 1958).\n\nTilly famously shot Parsons in the leg after an argument only months before they were married. This shooting occurred at her other Sydney residence: 191 Palmer Street, Darlinghurst . The house was almost opposite the notorious Tradesman's Arms Hotel . It was at this hotel that Devine met Eric Parsons. She was arrested by police and charged with the shooting, but was acquitted at trial on 31 March 1945. They were happily married for 13 years until Eric Parsons died of cancer on 22 November 1958.\n\nFor over 30 years, Devine lived at 335 Malabar Road, Maroubra in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs . A number of homicides were committed at this residence. The property remained derelict from the 1950s onwards. It was sold in 2009 and the new owner built a new house on the lot.\n\nDecline and death\n\nAlthough Devine had been one of Sydney's wealthiest women, by 1955 the Taxation Department ordered her to pay more than \u00a320,000 in unpaid income tax and fines sending her close to bankruptcy. In 1953 Devine boasted to the media, \"I am a lucky, lucky girl. I have more diamonds than the Queen of England's stowaways \u2013 and better ones too!\" She sold off her last brothel in Palmer Street, Darlinghurst in 1968, and died two years later.\n\nDevine was famous for flamboyant acts of generosity, and also for her violent feud with criminal vice rival Kate Leigh . Devine was charged by the famous Sydney Detective Frank Farrell on many occasions, and their feud lasted for 30 years.\n\nDevine had suffered from chronic bronchitis for 20 years, and died of cancer, aged 70 at the Concord Repatriation Hospital in Sydney on 24 November 1970. Her funeral service was held at the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, Darlinghurst. She was cremated at Botany Crematorium, now known as Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park , on 26 November 1970 with Catholic rites by her married name, Matilda Mary Parsons. She was survived by her son Frederick Ralph (Devine) Twiss (1919\u20131978) and 2 grandchildren. Her funeral service was poorly attended and her death went virtually unnoticed by Sydney's media and population and it was said that very few people openly mourned her death. The only public eulogy offered to Devine was given by the then police commissioner Norman Allan who said: \"She was a villain, but who am I to judge her?\"\n\nIn popular culture\n\nPeter Kenna wrote a play called The Slaughter of St Teresa\u2019s Day (1973 Currency Press), where the lead character was based on Devine.\n\nThe song \"Miss Divine\" from the 1990 Icehouse album Code Blue is about Devine.\n\nA popular cafe-nightclub in Lyneham , Canberra is called Tilleys Devine Cafe Gallery . A wine bar in Darlinghurst , Sydney opened in 2011, named \"Love Tilly Devine\" in honour of Devine.\n\nIn August 2011, Australia's Channel Nine commenced screening Underbelly: Razor , a true crime television drama series that deals with the Leigh/Devine Sydney gangland wars in the 1930s. The series was based on the Ned Kelly Award -winning book by Larry Writer. Devine was portrayed by Chelsie Preston Crayford , who was nominated for a Logie Award for Most Popular New Female Talent.\n\nDevine is a background character in Kerry Greenwood 's Death Before Wicket , the tenth Phryne Fisher novel, which is set in Sydney in 1928.\n\nTilley Devine is referenced in Ronni Salt\u2019s 2024 debut novel Gunnawah - a fictional Murray river town and the setting for a 1974 crime story.\n\nFurther reading"}

His research focuses on computational complexity theory , algorithms , combinatorics , and finite groups , with an emphasis on the interactions between these fields.\n\nLife\n\nIn 1968, Babai won a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad . Babai studied mathematics at Faculty of Science of the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University from 1968 to 1973, received a PhD from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1975, and received a DSc from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1984. He held a teaching position at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University since 1971; in 1987 he took joint positions as a professor in algebra at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd and in computer science at the University of Chicago. In 1995, he began a joint appointment in the mathematics department at Chicago and gave up his position at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd.\n\nWork\n\nHe is the author of over 180 academic papers. His notable accomplishments include the introduction of interactive proof systems , the introduction of the term Las Vegas algorithm , and the introduction of group theoretic methods in graph isomorphism testing. In November 2015, he announced a quasipolynomial time algorithm for the graph isomorphism problem .\n\nHe is editor-in-chief of the refereed online journal Theory of Computing . Babai was also involved in the creation of the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics program and first coined the name.\n\nGraph isomorphism in quasipolynomial time\n\nAfter announcing the result in 2015, Babai presented a paper proving that the graph isomorphism problem can be solved in quasi-polynomial time in 2016, at the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing . In response to an error discovered by Harald Helfgott , he posted an update in 2017.\n\nWe show that the Graph Isomorphism (GI) problem and the related problems of String Isomorphism (under group action) (SI) and Coset Intersection (CI) can be solved in quasipolynomial exp \u2061 ( ( log \u2061 n ) O ( 1 ) ) {\\displaystyle \\exp \\left(\\left(\\log n\\right)^{O\\left(1\\right)}\\right)} time. The best previous bound for GI was exp \u2061 ( O ( n log \u2061 n ) ) , {\\displaystyle \\exp \\left(O\\left({\\sqrt {n\\log n}}\\right)\\right),} where n {\\displaystyle n} is the number of vertices ( Luks , 1983); for the other two problems, the bound was similar, exp \u2061 ( O ~ ( n ) ) , {\\displaystyle \\quad \\qquad \\exp \\left({\\tilde {O}}\\left({\\sqrt {n}}\\right)\\right),} where n {\\displaystyle n} is the size of the permutation domain (Babai, 1983). The algorithm builds on Luks's SI framework and attacks the barrier configurations for Luks's algorithm by group theoretic \u00ablocal certificates\u00bb and combinatorial canonical partitioning techniques. We show that in a well-defined sense, Johnson graphs are the only obstructions to effective canonical partitioning.\n\nHonors\n\nIn 1988, Babai won the Hungarian State Prize, in 1990 he was elected as a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and in 1994 he became a full member. In 1999 the Budapest University of Technology and Economics awarded him an honorary doctorate.\n\nIn 1993, Babai was awarded the G\u00f6del Prize together with Shafi Goldwasser , Silvio Micali , Shlomo Moran , and Charles Rackoff , for their papers on interactive proof systems.\n\nIn 2015, he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , and won the Knuth Prize .\n\nBabai was an invited speaker at the International Congresses of Mathematicians in Kyoto (1990), Z\u00fcrich (1994, plenary talk), and Rio de Janeiro (2018).\n\nSources"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nobility", "content": "The British nobility is made up of the peerage and the gentry of the British Isles .\n\nThough the UK is today a constitutional monarchy with strong democratic elements, historically the British Isles were more predisposed towards aristocratic governance in which power was largely inherited and shared amongst a noble class. The nobility of the four constituent home nations and crown dependencies therefore has played a major role in shaping the history of the British Isles, and remnants of this nobility exist throughout the UK's social structure and institutions.\n\nTraditionally, the British nobility rank directly below the British royal family . In the modern era, this ranking is more of a formally recognised social dignity, rather than something conveying practical authority; however, through bodies such as the House of Lords , the nature of some offices in the Royal Household , and British property law, the British nobility retain some aspects of political and legal power.\n\nThe vast majority of the British nobility (in the Continental sense) is formed by the 'Gentry', which primarily consists of those who hold a coat of arms, but holds ranks including baronets , knights , esquires and gentlemen .\n\nAll ranks and titles of nobility in the British Isles that are higher than Gentleman are strictly personal and limited to the lifetime of the holder, though many can be transmitted by primogeniture , usually to heirs male of the body of the original recipient. Male-line descendants of members of the royal family, peers, baronets, knights and esquires do not sink below the rank of Gentleman as long as they are armigerous . Coats of arms are marks of nobility in Britain unlike on the Continent, where a grant of arms does not necessarily result in ennoblement or confirmation of nobility.\n\nThe British nobility should not be confused with the British upper class , though functionally the nobility may be said to make up a significant portion of the upper class. Those belonging to the upper or upper middle class are able to formally accede to the nobility by obtaining a grant of arms.\n\nThe Peerage\n\nThe British nobility in the narrow sense consists of Peers, not even including their wives. Members of the peerage carry the titles of duke , marquess , earl , viscount or baron (in Scotland historically lord of parliament ). British peers are sometimes referred to generically as lords , although individual dukes are not so styled when addressed or by reference, and those holding some offices are afford the title \"Lord\" by courtesy.\n\nAll modern British peerage dignities are created directly by the Crown and take effect when letters patent are issued, affixed with the Great Seal of the Realm . The Sovereign is considered to be the fount of honour and, as \"the fountain and source of all dignities cannot hold a dignity from himself\", cannot hold a British peerage. Peerages inherited by the Crown, for example those held by the Prince of Wales upon the demise of the monarch, merge with it and can be regranted to a new individual.\n\nMembership in the Peerage is strictly personal and for life ( life peerages ) though often heritable ( hereditary peerages ) primarily by agnatic primogeniture with some exceptions . All British subjects who are not themselves Peers of the Realm are technically commoners , regardless of ancestry, wealth, or other social factors. This includes Princes of the United Kingdom who have not yet been granted a Peerage. The term \"Commoner\" does not imply that the person is not noble in the Continental sense, but rather that he is not a Peer and is therefore entitled to be elected to the House of Commons .\n\nUnlike the feudal titles they replaced, peerages are personal title that cannot be transferred, bought, or sold by the title holder. Historically monarchs sold peerage titles under limited circumstances. This was often done to raise funds. For example, in the early Stuart period , King James I sold peerages, adding sixty-two peers to a body that had included just fifty-nine members at the commencement of his reign. Some governments through history also sold peerages to fund government activities, or more controversially, party activities. The selling of peerage grants by a government was made illegal in 1925 with the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925 . The act was the result of the administration of David Lloyd George selling a high number of controversial peerages. The Blair administration was later accused of trying to skirt this law in 2006 in the so called \" Cash-for-Honours scandal \", as was an aide of Prince Charles in the 2021 Cash-for-Favours scandal .\n\nLists\n\nThe Gentry\n\nThe vast majority of the British nobility is formed by the gentry. These individuals are commoners (in the British sense) who do not have a peerage, but possess another mark of nobility, or in the British sense, gentility.\n\nOther than their designation, such as Gentleman or Esquire , they enjoy only the privilege of a position in the formal orders of precedence in the United Kingdom . The largest portion of the British aristocracy has historically been the landed gentry , made up of baronets and other non-titled armigerous landowners whose families hailed from the medieval feudal class (referred to as gentlemen due to their income solely deriving from land ownership). Roughly a third of British land is owned by the nobility and landed gentry.\n\nChildren of Peers\n\nThe eldest sons of Peers who are Earls or higher and possess multiple titles may use their father's next-lower title by courtesy , their own eldest sons may use the third-highest title and so on. They are not Peers but remain Esquires until they inherit the substantive peerage themselves. Until 1999, they could sit in the House of Lords by virtue of a Writ of Acceleration .\n\nBaronets and Knights\n\nBaronets are generally considered part of the gentry, being hereditarily titled but not Peers, and form the upper tier. They entitle the holder to the title \"Sir/Lady [name]\", and will be recognised as the \"Baronet of [placename]\". The position is therefore comparable with hereditary knighthoods in continental European orders of nobility, such as Ritter , rather than with knighthoods under the British orders of chivalry. However, unlike the continental orders, the British baronetcy system was a modern invention. Baronet titles cannot be bought and sold by the holder, however they were designed specifically to raise money for the Crown with the purchase of the title. No new Baronetcies have been issued since the 1980's, however there is nothing preventing future monarchs or governments from doing so.\n\nIn the British isles Knighthoods are not hereditary, with the exception of three Irish hereditary knighthoods created for their kinsmen by the Earls of Desmond . Since 2011, all but one of the knighthoods are dormant. The only active one being the Knight of Kerry (Green Knight) \u2013 the holder is Sir Adrian FitzGerald , 6th Baronet of Valencia, 24th Knight of Kerry. Unlike other knighthoods they do not entitle the holder to the title 'Sir', but rather 'Knight'.\n\nKnighthoods in the UK are typically honours associated with orders of chivalry , with knights ranking in accordance with these orders. The exception is the lowest tier of knighthood Knight Bachelor which is not associated with any order.\n\nHistorically the rank of Knight banneret (knights created by the sovereign on the field of battle) also existed, though it is disputed by historians whether any have been created since the time of George I . Traditionally these knights would rank above all other members of the gentry, including Baronets (or directly below Baronets depending on the terms of creation).\n\nBarons in Scotland\n\nIn Scotland, a ' baron ' or 'baroness' is a hereditary title of honour in the Baronage of Scotland , but distinct from peerages. Historically called feudal barons but in 2004, the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act abolished all feudal aspects of baronies while preserving the nobility and dignity of the titles. Today, baronies are non-territorial personal titles, otherwise known as incorporeal hereditaments , just like hereditary peerages, baronetcies and coat of arms but unlike them, can be transferred outside the bloodline or bequeathed to an appointed heir. Higher ranks within the Baronage of Scotland, such as lordship, earldom, marquessate, and dukedom, exist but are less common. Innes of Learney , a noted heraldic authority and former Lord Lyon King of Arms representing the monarch in Scotland, stated that Scottish barons are equivalent to Continental barons.\n\nThe Barony of the Bachuil is a unique Scottish barony in two regards: firstly, because it belongs to whoever is the legal possessor of a particular ancient stick, and secondly, because it is held \" By the Grace of God \" making its holder the only person other than the King entitled to this style. The title is in the possession of the Chief of Clan Livingstone . The Barony is therefore considered to be allodial and not of feudal origin.\n\nIn contrast, feudal baronies including recognition for the titles were abolished in England and Ireland much earlier in the 16th century, having been replaced with peerage barons. Unlike in Scotland the lowest rank of the peerage being Lord of Parliament and baron being a territorial rank of nobility. In Scotland, feudal baronies were abolished 2004, but with full continued legal recognition for the titles.\n\nEsquires and Gentlemen\n\nThe rank of Esquire in the British isles was historically a title of respect accorded to men of higher social rank than that of gentlemen. It dated from the military rank of squire , who was a personal attendant to a knight. In a more modern sense it served as a category indicating \"candidates for knighthood\", and was therefore typically associated with certain professions (such as judges , justices of the peace , and sheriffs ). It was also associated with lords of the manor (who made up the traditional 'squirearchy'), as well as certain personal attendants and courtiers to the King, and those who had been presented with a Collar of Esses .\n\nIn a contemporary sense, Esquire is often used as a courtesy title in formal address, appended to a man's name when no other title is used, however this does not imply the recipient is actually considered to be at the rank of esquire. The heraldic authorities have specific criteria for whom they consider to be an esquire.\n\nSons of Peers, the primogeniture heirs of Knights as well as the heirs of certain individuals created such by the Crown are Esquires. A rare hereditary variety of English esquire is found in the West Country , primarily in Devonshire , called White Spur . Though it is possible there remain White Spur families in existence, the title is now not used. The form of usage or style was: \"(Surname) the White Spur\".\n\nThe untitled nobility consists first and foremost of all those who bear formally matriculated, or recorded, armorial bearings (a coat of arms). the Sovereign Military Order of Malta both consider armorial bearings as the main, if not sole, mark of gentility (untitled nobility) in Britain. Those who are noble but have no higher title or rank are Gentlemen. The next-higher rank is that of Esquire, which is usually not considered a title.\n\nThe only kind of gentility that is transmitted to all descendants (in the male line) is that established by a grant , matriculation or confirmation of arms. Men entitled to arms are archaically called gentlemen of coat armour . Lyon Innes of Learney introduced the term Noblesse referring specifically to the Scottish armigerous gentry, but it is unpopular with some modern heraldic enthusiasts.\n\nIn Scotland, arms are only transmitted by primogeniture and younger sons must matriculate differenced arms. Nevertheless, male-line descendants of an armiger who have not yet matriculated differenced arms are usually also considered gentlemen by birth.\n\nCertain offices and ranks confer gentility or even the rank of Esquire for life or for the duration of office. This includes barristers, professors, doctors, military officers and senior civil servants. Those who hold or have held personal gentility or the designation of Esquire by office are generally considered eligible for a grant of arms and can thus obtain hereditary gentility fairly easily.\n\nEligibility for a grant of arms can also be established by social status alone. There are no fixed criteria but it is generally understood that only a minority of those who would theoretically be entitled to a grant make use of the possibility.\n\nA grant of arms made to a person who is not a subject of the King, i.e. not a citizen of a Commonwealth realm, does not constitute the recipient a member of the British gentry. However, later naturalisation has constitutive effect and a new warrant is not needed, unlike for turning a honorary knighthood into a substantive one.\n\nClan Chiefs\n\nScottish and Irish Clan chiefs and chieftains form a rank of nobility. The title is hereditary but succession is more flexible than with most other titles. In Scotland, only those recognised as such by the Lord Lyon are considered legitimate Chiefs and there is a procedure for Clans currently lacking a chief to choose one.\n\nFeudal Titles\n\nPrior to the creation of the peerage, the nobility of the British isles was predominantly ordered according to feudalism. Feudal titles are the only titles that can be bought and sold freely by the holder, and are also not considered honours. For the most part there is no longer a formal tie between land and feudal titles in either England or Scotland, however many feudal titles are still connected to land rights. For example, the Marquess of Salisbury owns the mineral rights below Welwyn Garden City , not because of the peerage, but because he also owns the separate historic feudal title \" Lord of the Manor of Hatfield \" which granted these rights. Many feudal titles are still in the possession of noble families, and noble individuals owning Scottish baronies formerly enjoyed heraldic privileges. Some feudal titles held by Grand Serjeanty include (now) ceremonial offices of state, for example the King's Champion is an office held by the Lord of the Manor of Scrivelsby in Lincolnshire. It is debated whether any feudal title alone can in the present era afford nobility. In theory for example, a Lord of the Manor holds the rank of Esquire, but would only be considered noble if they also held a coat of arms, and the possession of such a title does not always guarantee eligibility.\n\nThe historically feudal title Lord of the manor continues to exist in England to this day, and the status of lord of the manor is often associated with the rank of esquire by prescription. Landed Lords of the Manor historically made up the majority of the gentry in England. A lordship of the manor does not entitle the holder to the title of 'Lord'. Ownership can be noted on request in British passports through an official observation worded, 'The Holder is the Lord of the Manor of [place name]'.\n\nIn Scotland, the approximate equivalent title to Lord of the manor is Laird . This rank is held only by those holding official recognition in a territorial designation by the Lord Lyon King of Arms . They are usually styled [name] [surname] of [lairdship]. The title of Laird cannot be acquired by purchasing a souvenir plot and Lord Lyon warns against the activities of companies purporting to confer it that way. Lairdships do not confer nobility in themselves if the Laird does not petition for a grant of arms, and the possession of such a title does not guarantee eligibility.\n\nIn the Channel Islands, there are Seigneuries . The most notable Seigneur is that of Sark , who until recently enjoyed considerable legal privileges. Feudalism has retained a more prominent role in the Channel Islands than in the UK. The Channel Islands are remnants of the Duchy of Normandy and are held directly by the crown on a feudal basis as they are self-governing possessions of the British Crown. The 'Squirearchy' or seigneurial class has been paramount in the social hierarchy of Jersey and Guernsey for many centuries, and some of its members still participate annually in the Court of Chief Pleas in Guernsey and the Assize d'Heritage in Jersey. Seigneurs were (and are) commonly referred to by the names of their fiefs. Purchasing a Channel Island fief is possible for anyone, regardless of nationality or citizenship. However, this occurs infrequently, as fiefs tend to pass down within families.\n\nOthers\n\nDescendants in the male line of peers and children of women who are peeresses in their own right, as well as of baronets , knights , dames , and of non-armigerous landowning families are typically considered members of the gentry informally but must apply for a grant of arms to join a formal nobility association. Their social status will typically make them eligible for a grant.\n\nLists and articles\n\nEnnoblement\n\nThe Monarch grants Peerages, Baronetcies and Knighthoods to citizens of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth Realms at the advice of the Prime Minister. Honours lists are published regularly at important occasions. Hereditary titles have been seldom conferred on non-royals since 1965.\n\nUntitled nobility, i.e. gentility, being identical to armigerousness , falls into the jurisdiction of the College of Arms and Lyon Court . Part of the Monarch's fons honorum\u2014the power to grant arms\u2014has been de facto devolved to Garter King of Arms and Lord Lyon King of Arms , respectively. A grant of arms is in every regard equivalent to a patent of nobility on the Continent; depending on jurisdiction and circumstances it can be seen as either an act of ennoblement or a confirmation of nobility.\n\nThus, along with Belgium and Spain , the United Kingdom remains one of the few countries in which nobility is still granted and the nobility (except for the hereditary peerage and baronetage) does not form a closed, purely \"historical\" class.\n\nPositions requiring nobility\n\nThere is a number of positions, such as ceremonial offices in government, in public organisations and membership in orders of chivalry, that require existing nobility. Usually, the requirement can be satisfied by obtaining a new grant.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly English period\n\nIn the 5th century, Germanic peoples collectively known as Anglo-Saxons migrated to sub-Roman Britain and came to dominate the east and southeast of the island. Around half the population were free, independent farmers ( Old English : ceorlas ) who cultivated a hide of land (enough to provide for a family). Slaves , mostly native Britons , made up the other half. By the late 6th century, the archeological evidence (grander burials and buildings) suggests the development of a social elite. The Late Antique Little Ice Age and the Plague of Justinian may have caused famine and other societal disruptions that compelled previously independent farmers to submit to the rule of strong lords. The Old English word for lord is hlaford ( ' loaf-guardian ' or ' bread-giver ' ).\n\nThe early law codes of Kent use the Old English word eorl ( ' high born ' , ' noble ' ) to describe an aristocrat. By the 8th century, the word gesith ( ' companion ' ; Latin : comes ) had replaced eorl as the common term for a nobleman.\n\nBy the 10th century, Anglo-Saxon society was divided into three main social classes: slaves, ceorlas ( ' free men ' ), and \u00feegnas ( ' thegns ' , ' aristocrats ' ). Thegn (Old English: \u00fee\u0121n ) meant servant or warrior, and it replaced the term gesith in the 10th century. In 1066, there were an estimated 5,000 thegns in England. Thegns were the backbone of local government and the military. Sheriffs were drawn from this class, and thegns were required to attend the shire court and give judgment. For these reasons, historian David Carpenter described thegns as \"the country gentry of Anglo-Saxon England\".\n\nThegns were divided into three ranks: ealdormen , king's thegns, and median thegns. The ealdorman was an official appointed by the king to administer a shire or group of shires (an ealdormanry). In the 11th century, while England was ruled by a Danish dynasty , the office changed from ealdorman to earl (related to Old English eorl and Scandinavian jarl ). After the king, the earl was the most powerful secular magnate . During Edward the Confessor 's reign (1042\u20131066), there were four principal earldoms: Wessex , Mercia , Northumbria , and East Anglia . Below ealdormen were king's thegns, so called because they only served the king. The lowest thegnly rank were the median thegns who owed service to other thegns.\n\nHigh-ranking members of the church hierarchy ( archbishops , bishops and abbots ) paralleled the secular aristocracy. The church's power derived from its spiritual authority as well as its virtual monopoly on education . Secular government depended on educated clergy to function, and prelates were important politicians and royal advisers in the witan (the king's council).\n\nNorman period (1066\u20131154)\n\nThe Norman Conquest of 1066 marked the creation of a new, French-speaking Anglo-Norman aristocracy with estates in both Normandy and England. This cross- Channel aristocracy also included smaller groups originating from other parts of France, such as Brittany , Boulogne , and Flanders .\n\nWhen William I ( r. 1066\u20131087 ) confiscated the property of the old Anglo-Saxon nobility, he kept 17 percent of the land as his royal demesne (now the Crown Estate ). The rest was given to the Conqueror's companions and other followers. According to the Domesday Book of 1086, the rest of the land was distributed as follows:\n\nLand was distributed according to the rules of feudalism . Vassals were granted fiefs in return for military service and counsel. These vassals were called tenants-in-chief because they held land directly from the king. According to Domesday Book, there were 1,100 tenants-in-chief in 1086. Those with estates worth over \u00a330 a year were considered the greater tenants-in-chief. Those with smaller estates were considered the lesser tenants-in-chief.\n\nThe greater tenants-in-chief constituted the highest ranks of the Anglo-Norman aristocracy: earls and the king's barons (see Feudal baron ) . The Normans continued to use the title of earl and equated it with the title of count (Latin: comes ) used in Normandy. This was the only hereditary title before 1337, and it was the most exclusive rank within the aristocracy. Between 1000 and 1300, there were never more than 25 extant earldoms at any one time.\n\nBelow earls were the king's barons. Baron (Latin: baro ) originally meant \"man\". In Norman England, the term came to refer to the king's greater tenants-in-chief. King's barons corresponded to king's thegns in the Anglo-Saxon hierarchy. Baron was not yet a hereditary title but rather described a social status.\n\nThe estate of an earl or baron was called an honour . Domesday Book identifies around 170 greater tenants-in-chief, and the ten wealthiest among them owned 25 percent of the land:\n\nDomesday Book also records around 6,000 under-tenants. Earls and barons granted land to their own vassals in a process called subinfeudation . Their most important vassals were honorial barons, who were of lesser status than king's barons (see for example Barony of Halton ) . They corresponded to the lesser thegn of Anglo-Saxon England. Honorial barons were given manors in return for service and had their own tenants. For this reason, they were intermediate or mesne lords . These could also be wealthy and powerful, with some eclipsing the lesser important king's barons.\n\nThe lower ranks of the aristocracy included the landless younger sons of important families and wealthier knights (men who held substantial land by knight-service ). Poorer knights (whose knight's fees were small) were likely excluded from the aristocracy.\n\n13th century\n\nBy 1300, the knightly class or gentry numbered around 3,000 landholders. Half of these were dubbed knights, while the other half were styled esquire . The banneret was ranked below a baron but above a regular knight. There was overlap between this group and the \"lesser barons\".\n\nThe baronage (including barons, earls, and high-ranking churchmen) had a duty as tenants-in-chief to provide the king with advice when summoned to great councils . In the 1200s, the great council evolved into Parliament , a representative body that increasingly asserted for itself the right to consent to taxation. Initially, participation in Parliament was still determined by one's status as a tenant-in-chief. Earls and greater barons received a writ of summons issued directly from the king, while lesser barons were summoned through the local sheriffs. In the reign of Edward I (1272\u20131307), the first hereditary barons were created by writ . Over time, baronies by writ became the main method of creating baronies, and baronies by tenure became obsolete.\n\n20th century\n\nNon-hereditary positions began to be created again in 1867 for Law Lords . In 1958, the Life Peerages Act 1958 enabled (non-hereditary) life peers to sit in the House of Lords , and from then on the creation of hereditary peerages rapidly became obsolete, almost ceasing after 1964. This is only a convention, and was not observed by prime minister Margaret Thatcher , who asked the Queen to create three hereditary peerages (two of them, to men who had no heirs). Until changes in the twentieth century, only a proportion of those holding Scottish and Irish peerages were entitled by that title to sit in the House of Lords; these were nominated by their peers.\n\nUntil constitutional reforms soon after Tony Blair came to power (the House of Lords Act 1999 ), possession of a title in the peerage (except Irish) entitled its holder to a seat in the House of Lords. Since then, only 92 hereditary peers are entitled to sit in the House of Lords, of which 90 are elected by the hereditary peers by ballot and replaced on death. The two exceptions are the Earl Marshal (a position held by the Dukes of Norfolk ), who is responsible for certain ceremonial functions on state occasions, and the Lord Great Chamberlain (a position held in gross and one of a number of persons can hold it), who serves as the monarch's representative in Parliament and accompanies them on certain state occasions; both are automatically entitled to sit in the House. Typically, those due to inherit a peerage\u2014or indeed have done so, in recent times\u2014have been educated at one of the major public schools , such as Eton , Radley , Oundle , Winchester or Harrow .\n\nA member of the House of Lords cannot simultaneously be a member of the House of Commons . In 1960, Anthony Wedgwood Benn inherited his father's title as Viscount Stansgate . He fought and won the ensuing by-election, but was disqualified from taking his seat until the Peerage Act 1963 was passed enabling hereditary peers to renounce their titles. Titles, while often considered central to the upper class, are not always strictly so. Both Captain Mark Phillips and Vice-Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence , the respective first and second husbands of Princess Anne , do not hold peerages. Most members of the British upper class are untitled.\n\nTerritorial Designations\n\nThe term \"Territorial Designation\" can have one of two meanings, either referring to the name (or part of the name) of a British title, or to a portion of the surname recognised in Scotland.\n\nPeerages and Baronetcies\n\nThe name adopted by the grantee of a title of nobility originally was the name of his seat or principal manor, which often had also been adopted as his surname, for example the Berkeley family seated at Berkeley Castle had the surname \"de Berkeley\" (\"from Berkeley\") and gained the title Baron Berkeley , amongst many others. Dukes were originally named after counties, the earliest one being Duke of Cornwall (1337) followed by Duke of Norfolk (1483) and Duke of Somerset (1547). The Duke of Wellington (1814) is an early example of a dukedom being named after a mere village, or manor, after Wellington in Somerset.\n\nEarls, being in reality the \"Count\" of Continental Europe, were also named after the County over which they exercised control. The range of names adopted for titles gradually expanded from territorial names alone. Later titles used a wide variety of names, including surname (unrelated to territorial designation indicated by the French particule de ), for example in 1547 Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich . Edward Russell in 1697 was created Viscount Barfleur after a naval victory in foreign territory, setting a precedent which has been repeatedly followed. Later earldoms also adopted family names, and omitted the preposition \"of\", an early example being Earl Rivers created in 1466 for Richard Woodville, 1st Baron Rivers . The title was not derived from the name of a place, but from the family name de Redvers, or Reviers, Earls of Devon . Earl Ferrers was created in 1711 for Robert Shirley, 14th Baron Ferrers, whose earlier title was named after the de Ferrers family, or Norman origin. Another early example of a surname being used as a title is Earl Poulett (1706).\n\nModern life peers do not generally own large estates, from which to name their title, so more imagination is required, unless the simple option of using the surname is selected.\n\nIn Scotland\n\nIn Scotland, landowners may style themselves with a territorial designation, becoming \"Firstname Lastname of Estatename\", if recognised as such by Lord Lyon. To qualify, an estate must be located \"outwith a burgh\" (i.e. outside a city) and furthermore be of a certain size, as well as have a name (which becomes the territorial designation). Once recognised, the territorial designation becomes a part of the surname. It is heritable by primogeniture under male preference, just like most old Scottish dignities in absence of a different disposition by the holder; all daughters but only the eldest son may use it by courtesy. If a family holds on to an estate for three generations, its territorial designation will continue to be inherited even if the estate is sold.\n\nMany heads of ancient Scottish families, including some peers, clan chiefs and barons, prefer to be known by their territorial designation.\n\nIrish and Gaelic nobility\n\nOutside the United Kingdom, the remaining Gaelic nobility of Ireland continue informally to use their provincial titles, few are recognised as royal extraction by the British Royal Family such as O'Donovan family . As Ireland was nominally under the overlordship of the English Crown for between the 12th and 16th centuries, the Gaelic system coexisted with the British system. A modern survivor of this coexistence is the Baron Inchiquin , still referred to in Ireland as the Prince of Thomond . The Prince of Thomond is one of three remaining claimants to the non-existent, since the 12th century, High Kingship of Ireland , the others being The O'Neill , MacCarthy Mor dynasty and the O'Conor Don .\n\nChief of the Name was a clan designation which was effectively terminated in 1601 with the collapse of the Gaelic order, and which, through the policy of surrender and regrant, eliminated the role of a chief in a clan or sept structure. This does not mean there is no longer a Chief or a sept today. Contemporary individuals today designated or claiming a title of an Irish chief treat their title as hereditary, whereas chiefs in the Gaelic order were nominated and elected by a vote of their kinsmen. Modern \"chiefs\" of tribal septs descend from provincial and regional kings with pedigrees beginning in Late Antiquity , whereas Scottish chiefly lines arose well after the formation of the Kingdom of Scotland , (with the exception of the Clann Somhairle , or Clan Donald and Clan MacDougall , the two of royal origins). The related Irish M\u00f3r (\"Great\") is sometimes used by the dominant branches of the larger Irish dynasties to declare their status as the leading princes of the blood, e.g. MacCarthy Mor dynasty , lit. (The) Great Macarthy or \u00d3 N\u00e9ill M\u00f3r , lit. (The) Great O'Neill.\n\nFollowing the Norman invasion of Ireland several Hiberno-Norman families adopted Gaelic customs, the most prominent being the De Burgh dynasty and FitzGerald dynasty ; their use of Gaelic customs did not extend to their titles of nobility, as they continuously utilized titles granted under the authority of the English monarchy.\n\nJewish nobility\n\nBlack British nobility\n\nGallery\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nFurther reading"}
