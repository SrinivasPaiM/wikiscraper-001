{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamov_Ka-226", "content": "The Kamov Ka-226 ( NATO reporting name : Hoodlum ) is a small, twin-engine Russian utility helicopter . The Ka-226 features an interchangeable mission pod, rather than a conventional cabin, allowing the use of various accommodation or equipment configurations. The Ka-226 entered service in 2002.\n\nDevelopment\n\nA twin-turbine version of the successful reciprocating-engined Kamov Ka-26 , (the Kamov Ka-126 is the single-turbine version) the Ka-226 was initially announced in 1990. Originally developed to meet the requirements of the Russian disaster relief ministry, the aircraft first flew on 4 September 1997. Certification to Russian AP-29 \"A\" and \"B\" transport categories was granted on 31 October 2003. The Ka-226 entered production at \"Strela\" Orenburg and later in \"KumAPP\" Kumertau.\n\nIn December 2014 it was reported that India is in agreement with the Russian Federation to produce Ka-226T and Mi-17 on its territory. Under a 2011 contract with Russian Ministry of Defence, Kumertau Aviation Production Enterprise completed production of a batch of Ka-226.80 helicopters, which was delivered to the customer on 17 April 2015. \"The planned scope of the assignment of state contract signed with the Ministry of Defence in 2011 fully implemented with ahead of schedule deliveries. Prematurely delivered a large consignment of helicopters. Previously, under the state contract with the Russian Defence Ministry were also delivered several Ka-226.80 batches\", - said the Managing Director of Kumertau Aviation Production Enterprise (KumAPP) Viktor Novikov.\n\nIn April 2015 Certification of Ka-226T light multi-role helicopter powered by Turbomeca Arrius 2G engines from France has been successfully completed in Russia. Two Ka-226T helicopters took part in the flight test programme. The version of Ka-226T powered by Turbomeca Arrius 2G engines offers much better performance compared to production Ka-226s powered by Allison 250-C20R/2 engines. It was reported earlier that deliveries of Ka-226 helicopters manufactured by Kumertau Aviation Production Enterprise (Ka-226.50 and Ka-226.80 versions) and powered by Allison 250-C20R/2 engines were started in 2005. The helicopters were delivered to the Federal Security Service of Russian Federation (at least six aircraft), Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (11 aircraft), Russian Aerospace Forces (a total of 36 helicopters should be delivered) and Ukrainian Ministry of Emergency Situations (one helicopter). Next year the enterprise was to start implementation of a contract for delivery of 18 Ka-226TG helicopters to Gazpromavia. In late March 2017 Russian security structures received first 2 ship-based Ka-226Ts and the delivery of six helicopters was completed in April 2018. In March 2018 Russia issued a supplement to the certificate for Ka-226T helicopter that allows the machine to operate at high temperatures.\n\nFollowing selection of the Ka-226T to meet an India requirement for 197 helicopters, an agreement was signed in December 2015 for the creation of a joint venture between Rostec , Russian Helicopters and Hindustan Aeronautics to build the helicopters at a new factory to be built at Tumakuru in India. However  even after 7 years had passed nothing eventually came of the plan as not only did the potential $1 billion deal remained in the limbo as the Indian aerospace major Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) had not been able to iron out their differences over the transfer of technology, indigenous content, and the project\u2019s total cost. India later opted for the Indigenous HAL LUH made by Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd based on the design of HAL Dhruv as a replacement for the tender.\n\nDesign\n\nThe design is a refinement of the proven Ka-26, featuring interchangeable mission pods. The aircraft is fitted with a new rotor system, increased visibility nose, and new passenger cabin design. The Ka-226 also features a new transmission system and is made largely from composite materials.\n\nThe aircraft is fitted with trademark Kamov coaxial rotors , of advanced composite design, making the Ka-226 highly manoeuvrable and eliminating the need for a tail rotor.\n\nVariants\n\nThe Kamov Ka-226 is available in the following variants; Search and Rescue, medevac , disaster relief and patrol variants have been developed for the Russian Emergency Ministry . Air ambulance, police and fire fighting variants have been developed for the Russian government.\n\nOperators\n\nCurrent operators\n\nCancelled\n\nSpecifications (Ka-226T)\n\nData from www.kamov.ru\n\nGeneral characteristics\n\nPerformance\n\nRelated development\n\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era"}
