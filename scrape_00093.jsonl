He made two records for New West: No Other Love and Age of Miracles . After years of mostly European and UK success, 2002\u2019s No Other Love was a breakthrough record for Prophet stateside due to the success of the summer single \"Summertime Thing\" and endorsements from Lucinda Williams , who gave him the opening slot for her summer tour.\n\nProphet was signed to Yep Roc Records in 2007.\n\nRecorded in San Francisco and Nashville, 2007's Soap and Water received critical praise.  Prophet toured Europe and North America in support of the album and appeared with his band on the Late Show with David Letterman and Last Call with Carson Daly . To better motivate the various musicians and engineers who were involved in the production of this album, Prophet gave them a stake in the master recordings.\n\nProphet has contributed to several Kelly Willis records, and produced 2007's Translated From Love for Rykodisc . Willis and Prophet co-wrote six of the album's tracks and Prophet played guitar throughout.\n\nEvangeline Recording Co. released a limited-edition work entitled Dreaming Waylon's Dreams , which he recorded in San Francisco.  The record re-creates Waylon Jennings ' 1975 country album Dreaming My Dreams in its entirety and features, among others, members of American Music Club and Meat Beat Manifesto . The package and booklet were printed by the legendary Bruce Licher ( Savage Republic , Independent Music Project, REM fan club etc.) using a custom letterpress design on original stock. Included in the packaging is a recounting of the events surrounding the recording of the record by close friend John Murry (who also played on the record). Each piece was printed and numbered by hand on a circa 1930's printing press. Dreaming Waylon's Dreams is one of the rarest and most sought-after items in Prophet's discography.

Michael Hoinski of The Village Voice compared \u00a1Let Freedom Ring! to Bruce Springsteen 's Born in the U.S.A. , citing the recordings as \"albums that manifest patriotism through disenchantment, and both rely heavily on marginalized characters to expose socioeconomic woes.\"\n\nIn January 2011, he formed the Spanish Bombs along with Chris Von Sneidern and San Francisco rhythm section The Park. The Spanish Bombs performed The Clash 's LP London Calling in its entirety at the Actual Music Festival in Spain. This special project came at the invitation of curators Houston Party.
