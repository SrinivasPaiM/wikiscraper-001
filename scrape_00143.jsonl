He traveled later to Tarragona to study land surveying and Fine Arts. After obtaining outstanding qualifications he was sent to the Universidad de Barcelona to study Pharmacy on 1868, finishing his career on 1871.\n\nAfter the dethronement of Isabel II he was commissioned by fellow carlist chiefs to organize the revolutionary forces of the district of Valderrobres and the bordering towns of Gandesa and Alca\u00f1iz . Between 1870 and 1872 he was assigned to different military tasks until his formal adherence to the Carlist uprising in September 1873 under Tom\u00e1s Segarra's command.\n\nLeading a minor squad of 200 Aragonese volunteers, Fontcuberta achieved a series of minor-scale victories against liberals at Maella , Batea and Ulldecona forcing their capitulation. He defeated general Santa Pau at Morella and played an important role with his men at the victory of the acci\u00f3n de Ares the 25 November 1873.\n\nCommanding 150 foot soldiers and 50 cavalrymen he fought the liberal forces of Amposta and Tortosa , and was finally assigned to 4 rebel compa\u00f1\u00edas with which he successfully sieged Vinaroz in February 1874, being ascended to Commander afterwards.\n\nAs a commander he led the 5th Battalion of Maestrazgo , laid siege to Gandesa in June 1874 and was awarded at Villafranca del Cid the Second Class Red Cross of Military Merit. While directing the chemistry lab at the Hospital of Horta he was made a prisoner on 1875, but was soon released through an exchange. Once free he joined the Carlist Army of the North, led a rebel compa\u00f1\u00eda at Puente la Reina and was made a lieutenant colonel shortly before the war finished. After the war he was imprisoned by the government at Tortosa , where he would reside until his death once being acquitted.\n\nIntellectual activities\n\nFontcuberta founded and directed the traditionalist newspaper Semanario de Tortosa from 1882 to 1888. He sided with Ram\u00f3n Nocedal on the Carlist schism , being expulsed from the Traditionalist Communion after expressing his support for an Integrist newspaper at Pamplona. He kept writing for other newspapers and became a local leader of the Integrist Party .\n\nUsing the pen name \"Un te\u00f3logo de anta\u00f1o\" (a theologian from yesteryear) he published F\u00e9lix Sard\u00e0 y Salvany 's articles that would be later compiled on the manifesto Liberalism Is a Sin , which had a lasting influence on Spanish politics.\n\nApart from his journalist career, Fontcuberta worked for 18 years as a mathematics professor at the Seminary of Tortosa and taught various subjects at the San Luis de Gonzaga College for 27 years until his death. He also served as a pharmacist at Roquetas .\n\nFontcuberta was also an active member of the Catholic Worker's Circle of Tortosa. He was also a renowned collaborator of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul and would weekly visit the city's jail and hospital to do charitable works.\n\nDeath\n\nFontcuberta died of an apoplexy being 61 years old. El Siglo Futuro dedicated him an obituary stating that the Catholic Church in Spain had lost \"not only one of her best soldiers, but also a model for gentlemen, christians and spaniards, one of those the World is lacking nowadays\". Many other Carlist and catholic Tortosan newspapers paid homage to him: El Restaurador called him an \"enthusiast soldier of Tradition, for whose defense he fought ardently both with his sword and his quill\" and the Correo de Tortosa defined him as an \"exemplar gentleman and most upright catholic\".\n\nHe was married to Pilar Fontanet, with whom he had a daughter of her same name. Pilar Fontcuberta would later marry Joaqu\u00edn Ferrer y Ferrer, jaimist deputy and chief of the Traditionalist Communion of Tortosa, Roquetas and Gandesa.\n\nBibliography"}

He was a second baseman in Major League Baseball during the late 1880s and 1890s. Over that period of time, he played for the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association before joining many other major leaguers in jumping to the Brooklyn Ward's Wonders in the newly formed Players' League for the 1890 season, a league which folded after just one year of play.\n\nA \"piratical\" act\n\nWhen the Players' League folded in 1891, pretty much every player that left the National League or the American Association for the league in 1890 was allowed to return to their original team. However, Lou Bierbauer never signed a contract to return to the Philadelphia Athletics. The National League's Pittsburgh Alleghenys , realizing Bierbauer's absence in the Athletics lineup, soon became determined to sign him at all costs.\n\nAlfred Spink , the founder of the Sporting News , wrote about the incident in his 1910 book \"The National Game\". According to Spink, the Alleghenys' manager, Ned Hanlon , traveled to Erie in the dead of winter to sign him with the Alleghenys.\n\nThe Athletics, upon learning of this deal, objected to Bierbauer's signing and stated that he should return to the A's, since that was the team that employed him before his defection to the failed Players' League. An official for the American Association also objected to Bierbauer signing with the Alleghenys and called the act \"piratical.\" However the Alleghenys contended that since \"the [American Association] did not reserve Bierbauer, he was a free agent\". An arbitrator agreed, and soon players and fans alike were calling the team the \" Pirates .\"\n\nLegacy\n\nBierbauer played for the Pirates for six seasons before moving on to the St. Louis Browns from 1897 to 1898. He later finished his professional baseball career in the minor leagues .\n\nAlfred Spink would go on to call Bierbauer the \"one-time king of second basemen\", a great \"all-around player\" who dominated both the National League and the American Association. In a 1955 story also reprinted in The Pirates Reader , a friend of Bierbauer told the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph that \"Louie loved the Pirates and rooted for them until the day of his death in 1926.\"\n\nBierbauer died in his hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania at the age of 60, and is interred at Erie Cemetery ."}
