{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viacom_Productions", "content": "Viacom Productions (formerly Viacom Enterprises ) was a television production arm of Viacom . Viacom Enterprises was also a movie producer , and a sports producer . The division was active from 1971 until 2004, when the company was folded into Paramount Television 10 years following Viacom's acquisition of Paramount Pictures , and led Perry Simon to move itself to Paramount for a production deal.\n\nHistory\n\nViacom Enterprises was formed in 1971 as the successor of the pre-1968 CBS Films, later reincorporated as CBS Enterprises, Inc. in 1968. The company began handling the production and distribution of films around the same time, under the name \"Viacom Productions\" to produce first-run television series airing on the major networks. In 1971, it was spun-off because it was against the FCC regulations for a television network to distribute its programs under its own name .\n\nIn 1977, after failed attempts to launch prime-time shows, Viacom decided to set up its own unit for prime-time programming, which was headed by Richard Reisberg, who had also saw program acquisition activities.\n\nThe first primetime television show, movie, or sports to be produced by Viacom Productions for the ABC network was The MacKenzies of Paradise Cove . The studio had development contracts with independent writers and producers. The studio made significant deals in 1977, when Roland Kibbee and Dean Hargrove left Universal for Viacom.\n\nIn 1984, Thomas D. Tannenbaum became president of the studio.\n\nOn March 11, 1994, Viacom acquired Paramount Communications , Inc. and Viacom Enterprises was folded into Paramount Domestic Television , by transferring the domestic rights of the Viacom library. Viacom International was later reorganized as the parent company of MTV Networks and Showtime Networks . Viacom transferred the international rights of the said library into Paramount International Television , while Viacom Productions was reincorporated as a production sub-division of Paramount Television. The first hit came after the acquisition was Sabrina, the Teenage Witch , a show ABC aired from 1996 to 2000, followed by a run on The WB from 2000 to 2003.\n\nViacom Productions was folded into Paramount Network Television in 2004, amid financial troubles brought on to Viacom. The final two series to end under the Viacom Productions name are Ed and The Division .\n\nViacom Pictures\n\nFrom 1989 to 2011, Viacom Productions produced some theatrical films and television films (primarily Showtime ) under the brand Viacom Pictures . Viacom Pictures stopped producing theatrical films around 1995, after its parent acquired Paramount Communications, the parent of Paramount Pictures , though it continued to produce television films until 2011.\n\nFilmography\n\nNote\n\nThe 4400 continued as a Paramount Network Television production for season 2. The show became a CBS Paramount Network Television production for its last two seasons after the Viacom / CBS split at the end of 2005.\n\nAll shows from Viacom Productions are now owned by CBS Studios Productions, LLC. , a holding company, and distributed by CBS Television Distribution ."}
