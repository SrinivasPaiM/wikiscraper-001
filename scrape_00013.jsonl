These flies have a black thorax, but males have a mesonotum with golden pruinosity up to the transverse suture. Scutellum is black with two pairs of marginal setae and a quite characteristic red sub-globular abdomen, without setae but with large black markings in the middle. In the females thorax before the scutellum has three spots of dusting. Abdominal tergites are completely fused. The compound eyes are red. Antennae are black. Wings are slightly darkened, with yellow basicostae. Femora and tibiae are black.\n\nBiology\n\nAdults can be found from May to October. These flies are endoparasites of various Pentatomidae species, on which the females lay their eggs. Larvae will develop inside them. Known larval hosts of these parasitic flies are Ancyrosoma leucogrammes , Carpocoris pudicus , Cydnus aterrimus , Dolycoris baccarum , Eurygaster integriceps , Nezara viridula , Palomena prasina , Piezodorus lituratus .\n\nThis article related to members of the fly family Tachinidae is a stub .

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downgrade_attack", "content": "A downgrade attack , also called a bidding-down attack, or version rollback attack , is a form of cryptographic attack on a computer system or communications protocol that makes it abandon a high-quality mode of operation (e.g. an encrypted connection ) in favor of an older, lower-quality mode of operation (e.g. cleartext ) that is typically provided for backward compatibility with older systems. An example of such a flaw was found in OpenSSL that allowed the attacker to negotiate the use of a lower version of TLS between the client and server. This is one of the most common types of downgrade attacks. Opportunistic encryption protocols such as STARTTLS are generally vulnerable to downgrade attacks, as they, by design, fall back to unencrypted communication.  Websites which rely on redirects from unencrypted HTTP to encrypted HTTPS can also be vulnerable to downgrade attacks (e.g., sslstrip ), as the initial redirect is not protected by encryption.\n\nAttack\n\nDowngrade attacks are often implemented as part of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, and may be used as a way of enabling a cryptographic attack that might not be possible otherwise. Downgrade attacks have been a consistent problem with the SSL/TLS family of protocols; examples of such attacks include the POODLE attack.\n\nDowngrade attacks in the TLS protocol take many forms. Researchers have classified downgrade attacks with respect to four different vectors, which represents a framework to reason about downgrade attacks as follows:\n\nThere are some recent proposals that exploit the concept of prior knowledge to enable TLS clients (e.g. web browsers) to protect sensitive domain names against certain types of downgrade attacks that exploit the clients' support for legacy versions or non-recommended ciphersuites (e.g. those that do not support forward secrecy or authenticated encryption) such as the POODLE, ClientHello fragmentation, and a variant of the DROWN (aka \"the special drown\") downgrade attacks.\n\nRemoving backward compatibility is often the only way to prevent downgrade attacks. However, sometimes the client and server can recognize each other as up-to-date in a manner that prevents them. For example, if a Web server and user agent both implement HTTP Strict Transport Security and the user agent knows this of the server (either by having previously accessed it over HTTPS, or because it is on an \"HSTS preload list\" ), then the user agent will refuse to access the site over vanilla HTTP, even if a malicious router represents it and the server to each other as not being HTTPS-capable."}
