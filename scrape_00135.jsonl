Shortly after, the family moved to Saitama Prefecture . Yamazaki started writing fiction as a senior at Kokugakuin University , graduating there with a thesis on the character Ukifune in The Tale of Genji .

Katsura Biy\u014dshitsu besshitsu ( \u30ab\u30c4\u30e9\u7f8e\u5bb9\u5ba4\u5225\u5ba4 ) , Yamazaki's 2007 novel about the relationships among people who meet at a beauty salon, was nominated for the 138th Akutagawa Prize and survived the first round of voting by the selection committee, but ultimately did not win, as the prize went to Mieko Kawakami . Their story Te ( \u624b , Hand ) , later included in a 2009 collection of the same name, was nominated for the 140th Akutagawa Prize. Niki no kutsujoku ( \u30cb\u30ad\u306e\u5c48\u8fb1 , Niki's Humiliation ) , a romance novel about the relationship between a popular photographer and a photographer's assistant, was nominated for the 145th Akutagawa Prize.

Utsukushii kyori , a story about a married couple dealing with the wife's terminal cancer, subsequently won the 23rd Shimase Award for Love Stories.\n\nIn addition to their fiction, Yamazaki also publishes essays on non-traditional family life, including the 2016 collection Kawaii otto ( \u304b\u308f\u3044\u3044\u592b , Cute Husband ) , a series of essays about living in a family where the wife is more successful than the husband. After having their first child at the age of 37, Yamazaki wrote a series of essays about the first year of their child's life. The resulting book, Haha dewa nakute oya ni naru ( \u6bcd\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3001\u89aa\u306b\u306a\u308b , Becoming a Parent, Not a Mother ) , was published in 2017.\n\nYamazaki's first English-language book, a collection of short stories translated by Polly Barton , was published by Strangers Press under the title Friendship for Grown Ups in 2017. In a review for The Japan Society of the UK , Eluned Gramich noted that Yamazaki \"seems more interested in the distance between lovers than in what unites them\", but also called Friendship for Grown Ups \"funny and clever\". The Japan Times praised Yamazaki's \"skill in evoking the ambiguity of contemporary life\" and called the collection \"a small book that says a lot about the way we live today\".\n\nRecognition\n\nWorks\n\nSelected works in Japanese\n\nSelected works in English"}
