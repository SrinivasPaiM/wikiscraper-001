Roosevelt Democratic\n\nThe 1940 United States presidential election in Wyoming took place on November 5, 1940, as part of the 1940 United States presidential election . State voters chose three representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College , who voted for president and vice president .\n\nWyoming was won by incumbent Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt , running with the 11th Secretary of Agriculture , Henry A. Wallace , as his vice president, with 52.82 percent of the popular vote, against the Republican candidate , American lawyer and corporate executive Wendell Willkie , running with Oregon senator Charles L. McNary , with 46.89 percent of the popular vote. Willkie outperformed Alf Landon's 1936 result by 17 points, and flipped 9 counties that Landon lost: Big Horn , Campell , Converse , Fremont , Goshen , Niobrara , Sublette , Washakie , and Weston .\n\nThough originally against running for an unprecedented third term, Roosevelt was driven to do so after the outbreak of World War II in Europe when Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 . With the American public strongly against intervention in Europe, Roosevelt and Willkie both promised not to get America involved in any foreign wars, however Willkie accused Roosevelt of not doing enough to prepare for the possibility of war, which the incumbent rebutted when he built up America's military and transformed it into \"The Arsenal of Democracy\" . The Republicans then changed tactics and used this to accuse Roosevelt of secretly attempting to bring America into WW2, which Roosevelt had difficulty responding to and was more damaged by. Though the previous two elections had been largely contested over The Great Depression , by 1939 the United States had begun emerging from the Depression, however it would still be an important issue in the campaign as Roosevelt's \"New Deal\" programs were widely popular among voters and seen as ending the Depression, while Willkie, a wealthy corporate executive, was damaged by his ties to Big Business, which working class voters still blamed for the Depression. Willkie also warned about the dangers of breaking the two-term tradition, which was first begun by George Washington in 1789, and attacked Roosevelt for perceived incompetence and waste in his New Deal welfare programs. Despite his criticisms, Willkie said that he would keep most of the New Deal programs, and would make them more efficient.\n\nBecause the country was locked in conflict with Nazi Germany , the United Kingdom actively interfered in the election, attempting to persuade Americans to abandon their isolationist positions and join the fight. The U.K. strongly backed Roosevelt, but attempted to interfere in the Republican primaries to push a more hawkish candidate. America ultimately wouldn't enter the war against Germany until December 10th, 1941 , a few days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor .\n\nWith many voters wary of breaking the two-term tradition, Willkie vastly outperformed Alf Landon's 1936 results not only in Wyoming, but the entire nation, winning 10 states compared to Landon's 2. However, Roosevelt's popularity would prove too difficult to overcome, and he would successfully win an unprecedented third term. This would be the last occasion Teton County would vote for a Democratic presidential candidate until Bill Clinton carried the county in 1992 \u2013 since then it has become a Democratic island in the nation's \" reddest \" state. This would also be the third to last time that Wyoming would back the Democratic candidate in a presidential election and the last until 1948 , as Republican Thomas Dewey would carry the state in 1944 by a narrow margin .\n\nResults\n\nResults by county"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networked_book", "content": "A networked book is an open book designed to be written, edited, and read in a networked environment. It is also a platform for social exchange, and is potentially linked to other books and other discussions. Wikipedia can be considered a networked book. LetsAuthor is a publishing company that exclusively publishes networked books created on its platform.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nThe networked book has four primary characteristics:\n\nOpen book\n\nThe networked book maintains an open structure during all or part of its creation. For example, Lawrence Lessig 's, Code: Version 2.0 used a wiki to open the editing process for the second edition of Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace , in order to \"draw upon the creativity and knowledge of the community. This is an online, collaborative book update; a first of its kind. Once the project nears completion, Professor Lessig will take the contents of this wiki and ready it for publication.\" In other words, at some point the book was declared finished, and closed to further input and adjustment by the community.  Another example of an open book structure is the popular Wikipedia . This online wiki encyclopedia is entirely and indefinitely open.\n\nAnother example of a networked book is Turbulence.org's 2009 commissioned anthology, Networked: a (networked book) about (networked art) . The website explores writing, art, and culture in networked society, and explores the subject on multiple levels.  In addition to the thematic matter, the initial commissioned authors were invited to submit chapters using a blog or wiki format. While seven of the authors chose the blog format (with the CommentPress plugin), artist/theorist Patrick Lichty created a wiki -formatted chapter, \"Art in the Age of Dataflow\", which discusses literary theories of spatial narrative from its inception in the 1940s to the age of big data .  Like Lawrence Lessig 's text, Dataflow was intended as a propositional text from which the online community expand on the original chapter.  The chapter as it existed in 2012 was captured and included in Lichty's Institute for Networked Culture book, \"Variant Analyses, Interrogations of New Media Art and Culture\".\n\nStructurally granular or disaggregated\n\nThe networked book manifests a certain \"disarticulation of the body of text\" and \"disaggregated/reaggregated\" structure as described by Raffaele Simone in his essay, The Body of the Text. \"Disarticulation of the body of the text occurs when the text generated by an author is not perceived as closed to external interventions, an entity to which the author can have access only to read (or, to use an information science image, in the manner of ROM , that is \"read only\"), but as an open entity to which one has access\u2014for purposes of both reading and writing. When the text is disarticulated it is perceived as an entity which can be disaggregated (broken apart), manipulated, and reaggregated (reassembled) without damaging the text per se or the author.\"\n\nThe networked book is a form that helps us reconstruct and understand the prolific and increasingly granular world of information that surrounds us. Moreover, the networked book sets up formats that are often designed to update continually, incorporating new information and reconfiguring the book to accommodate new content and present it coherently.\n\nJonathan Harris' 10 x 10 builds its content from RSS feeds. The piece selects the most frequently used words from the major news networks to assemble an hourly \"portrait\" of our world. This visualization tool represents a type of structure that we will soon see in networked books. The human editor/programmer creates the search and visualization function and the machine then collects, edits, and presents text and images according to criteria built into the program. This type of \"book\" format depends on granular content that can be \"manipulated and reaggregated\" by a tool.\n\nSocial\n\nSocial software environments create spaces for communal authorship. They allow raw, unedited content to be collectively assembled within the nascent form of the electronic book itself, facilitating a gestational space for content to evolve from spontaneous discussion into an edited \"book\" according to the activity of the social network. LiveJournal is a useful model for socially networked books.\n\nThe multiple-author forum creates a different kind of thinking environment. Individual points of view are mediated by multiple voices. This may allow for a more democratic approach to issues and a multifaceted rendering of topics not possible in the single-author print model.\n\nProcessed\n\nThe future book will be a networked book or a \" processed book \" as Joseph Esposito [3] calls it. To process a book, he says, is more than simply building links to it; processing also includes a modification of the act of creation, which tends to encourage the absorption of the book into a network of applications, including but not restricted to commentary. This \"processing\" creates iterations of the book: critiques, revisions and trajectories that accumulate around the original draft. The iterations of Wikipedia are a good example of this principle. The networked book, as a process-based knowledge machine incorporates the thinking process of multiple authors.\n\nProcessing the networked book\n\nIt is useful, in this case, to compare the processing of a networked book to the standard editorial procedures found in print culture. Both print books and networked books originate from an idea conceived by a senior editor or an author. However, the participatory framework of a networked book is articulated by a designer, and executed by a programmer, before the content is written or assembled, thus creating an open book structure. Paper-based books are turned over to the designer, production artist and printer after the content is finished, resulting in a closed book structure. The networked book is assembled, in whole or in part, by a community of authors according to the thesis imagined by the editor/author and within the space created by the designer and programmer. The community of contributors acts as both author and reader, which is drastically different from the single-author print model wherein, reader is audience rather than co-creator. In a networked book, content is generated and revised by the community and the various iterations of the text are often saved and can be returned to and discussed. In a paper-based book, content is generally constructed by a single author and is revised under the supervision of an editor. The readers have no part in this process and the revisions are only examined and debated in special cases, and then usually by scholars or authors, not by the general readership. After the content has been generated by the community within the framework of the network book's thesis and architecture, the reader/editor implements strategies for marking out meaningful pathways through the material using search engines and visualization applications."}
