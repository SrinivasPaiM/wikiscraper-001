Released on home video in 1985, the 75 minute documentary was made at the height of the band's global success following the release of their multi-platinum selling album Songs from the Big Chair .\n\nThe documentary was made by renowned music video and film director Nigel Dick , who had already made several promo videos with the band including their hits \" Shout \", \" Everybody Wants to Rule the World \", and \" Head Over Heels \". Filmed in England, Germany, Canada and the United States, it includes a variety of interviews with band members Roland Orzabal , Curt Smith , Ian Stanley and Manny Elias , footage from the band's 1985 \"Big Chair\" tour (both onstage and off), a segment where the band filmed a promotional appearance for Japanese television at Blenheim Palace in England, and clips from the promotional videos for the five singles released from the album (including the second promo video of the single \" Mothers Talk \" and also a brief behind the scenes look at making the \" Head Over Heels \" video).\n\nScenes from the Big Chair was also released on Laserdisc and the short-lived Video CD format. It was released on DVD in 2005, twenty years after its initial home video release. In addition to the documentary, the DVD also contains a new 35 minute interview with record producer Chris Hughes , recorded in 2005, as he reflects on the making of the album and its subsequent global success. The non-US/Canadian releases also contain the 90 minute Going to California concert performance which was recorded in Santa Barbara during the band's Seeds of Love World Tour in May 1990 (also directed by Nigel Dick and also previously available on home video).\n\nIt was reissued on DVD in 2014 as part of the 6-disc Super Deluxe Edition of Songs from the Big Chair . This version also contains the 2005 interview with Chris Hughes, but does not include the 1990 Going to California concert.\n\nUnlike the original VHS, Laserdisc and Video CD releases, the audio tracks for the DVD releases are available in 5.1 surround sound as well as 2.0 stereo.\n\nMusic produced by Chris Hughes .\n\nAs above and also features a 2005 interview with producer Chris Hughes and the non-US/Canadian versions include the 1990 Going to California concert video."}

It also appears in about 25% of intestinal MALTomas. Using immunohistochemistry , CD43 can be demonstrated in the paracortical T-cells of healthy lymph nodes and tonsils; it is also positive in a range of lymphoid and myeloid tumours. Although it is present in over 90% of T-cell lymphomas , it is generally less effective at demonstrating this condition than is CD3 antigen. However, it may be useful as part of a panel to demonstrate B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma , since the malignant cells in this condition are often CD43 positive, and may be difficult to stain with other antibodies. Because it stains granulocytes and their precursors, it is also an effective marker for myeloid tumours.\n\nInteractions\n\nCD43 has been shown to interact with EZR and Moesin .\n\nFurther reading\n\nThis membrane protein \u2013related article is a stub .
