The subjects he wrote about include Aristotelian philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and the concept of vacuum and its relationship with God.\n\nHe studied law before joining the Jesuits and following the curriculum in their college in Naples, later teaching logic, physics, metaphysics and theology. In his extensive writing he presented alternative theories, including those of Christopher Clavius and Copernicus , even when he disagreed with them, though theologians of that period did not always explain opposing views. He sought to establish workable science without undermining theology.\n\nBibliografia\n\nThis article about a theologian is a stub . You can help Wikipedia by expanding it ."}
