There are a number of applications that are developed from this research, and these are also considered parts of the process. The base system of analysis revolves around general genetics. Basic studies include identification of genes and inherited disorders . This research has been conducted for centuries on both a large-scale physical observation basis and on a more microscopic scale.\nGenetic analysis can be used generally to describe methods both used in and resulting from the sciences of genetics and molecular biology, or to applications resulting from this research.\n\nGenetic analysis may be done to identify genetic/inherited disorders and also to make a differential diagnosis in certain somatic diseases such as cancer . Genetic analyses of cancer include detection of mutations , fusion genes , and DNA copy number changes.\n\nHistory\n\nMuch of the research that set the foundation of genetic analysis began in prehistoric times. Early humans found that they could practice selective breeding to improve crops and animals. They also identified inherited traits in humans that were eliminated over the years. The many genetic analyses gradually evolved over time.\n\nMendelian research\n\nModern genetic analysis began in the mid-1800s with research conducted by Gregor Mendel . Mendel, who is known as the \"father of modern genetics\", was inspired to study variation in plants. Between 1856 and 1863, Mendel cultivated and tested some 29,000 pea plants (i.e., Pisum sativum). This study showed that one in four pea plants had purebred recessive alleles, two out of four were hybrid and one out of four were purebred dominant. His experiments led him to make two generalizations, the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment , which later became known as Mendel's Laws of Inheritance. Lacking the basic understanding of heredity, Mendel observed various organisms and first utilized genetic analysis to find that traits were inherited from parents and those traits could vary between children. Later, it was found that units within each cell are responsible for these traits. These units are called genes. Each gene is defined by a series of amino acids that create proteins responsible for genetic traits.\n\nTypes\n\nGenetic analyses include molecular technologies such as PCR , RT-PCR , DNA sequencing , and DNA microarrays , and cytogenetic methods such as karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridisation .\n\nDNA sequencing\n\nDNA sequencing is essential to the applications of genetic analysis. This process is used to determine the order of nucleotide bases . Each molecule of DNA is made from adenine , guanine , cytosine and thymine , which determine what function the genes will possess. This was first discovered during the 1970s. DNA sequencing encompasses biochemical methods for determining the order of the nucleotide bases, adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, in a DNA oligonucleotide. By generating a DNA sequence for a particular organism, you are determining the patterns that make up genetic traits and in some cases behaviors.\n\nSequencing methods have evolved from relatively laborious gel-based procedures to modern automated protocols based on dye labelling and detection in capillary electrophoresis that permit rapid large-scale sequencing of genomes and transcriptomes. Knowledge of DNA sequences of genes and other parts of the genome of organisms has become indispensable for basic research studying biological processes, as well as in applied fields such as diagnostic or forensic research. The advent of DNA sequencing has significantly accelerated biological research and discovery.\n\nCytogenetics\n\nCytogenetics is a branch of genetics that is concerned with the study of the structure and function of the cell, especially the chromosomes. Polymerase chain reaction studies the amplification of DNA. Because of the close analysis of chromosomes in cytogenetics, abnormalities are more readily seen and diagnosed.\n\nA karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. The term is also used for the complete set of chromosomes in a species, or an individual organism.\n\nKaryotypes describe the number of chromosomes, and what they look like under a light microscope. Attention is paid to their length, the position of the centromeres , banding pattern, any differences between the sex chromosomes, and any other physical characteristics. Karyotyping uses a system of studying chromosomes to identify genetic abnormalities and evolutionary changes in the past.\n\nDNA microarrays\n\nA DNA microarray is a collection of microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface. Scientists use DNA microarrays to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome. When a gene is expressed in a cell, it generates messenger RNA (mRNA). Overexpressed genes generate more mRNA than underexpressed genes. This can be detected on the microarray.\nSince an array can contain tens of thousands of probes, a microarray experiment can accomplish many genetic tests in parallel. Therefore, arrays have dramatically accelerated many types of investigations.\n\nPCR\n\nThe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a biochemical technology in molecular biology to amplify a single or a few copies of a piece of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence.\nPCR is now a common and often indispensable technique used in medical and biological research labs for a variety of applications. These include DNA cloning for sequencing, DNA-based phylogeny , or functional analysis of genes; the diagnosis of hereditary diseases ; the identification of genetic fingerprints (used in forensic sciences and paternity testing); and the detection and diagnosis of infectious diseases.\n\nApplications\n\nCancer\n\nNumerous practical advancements have been made in the field of genetics and molecular biology through the processes of genetic analysis. One of the most prevalent advancements during the late 20th and early 21st centuries is a greater understanding of cancer's link to genetics. By identifying which genes in the cancer cells are working abnormally, doctors can better diagnose and treat cancers.\n\nResearch\n\nResearch has been able to identify the concepts of genetic mutations, fusion genes and changes in DNA copy numbers, and advances are made in the field every day. Much of these applications have led to new types of sciences that use the foundations of genetic analysis. Reverse genetics uses the methods to determine what is missing in a genetic code or what can be added to change that code. Genetic linkage studies analyze the spatial arrangements of genes and chromosomes. There have also been studies to determine the legal and social and moral effects of the increase of genetic analysis. Genetic analysis may be done to identify genetic/inherited disorders and also to make a differential diagnosis in certain somatic diseases such as cancer. Genetic analyses of cancer include detection of mutations , fusion genes , and DNA copy number changes."}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluegrass_Memories", "content": "Bluegrass Memories is the 13th studio album by American bluegrass musician Bill Monroe and his band, the Blue Grass Boys . Released by MCA Records on October 3, 1977, it features ten songs recorded over three sessions at Bradley's Barn in Mount Juliet, Tennessee on July 25, 27 and 28, 1977. The album was produced by Walter Haynes .\n\nBackground\n\nBill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys went through a few late personnel changes just before the recording of Bluegrass Memories . First, after leaving the band in mid-March 1977, banjo player Bill Holden returned at the end of June, staying long enough for the sessions before leaving again in early-August. Next, fiddler Kenny Baker had to step back temporarily from the band, after suffering a \"deep cut\" to his left hand while showing his hunting knife to a few friends; he remained out of action until October that year while he recovered from \"emergency microsurgery \", with Norman \"Buddy\" Spicher stepping in to take his place at the upcoming sessions.\n\nRecording\n\nAt the first session on July 25, 1977, Monroe and his band started with a re-recording of Tex Logan 's Christmas song \" Christmas Time's A-Comin' \", which they had originally recorded for a single release in 1951. This was followed by the instrumental \"Texas Blue Bonnet\" (reportedly named in reference to Monroe's love interest Julie LaBella, who was from Texas) and the vocal trio track \"The Sunset Trail\". Two days later, another session produced \"My Sweet Memory\" and \"She's Young (And I'm Growing Old)\", both of which featured the vocal trio again, and a second instrumental, \"Blue Goose\". At a third and final session the day after, Monroe and his group tracked a second Christmas song, Virginia Stauffer's \"That's Christmas Time to Me\"; an instrumental banjo song written by Holden, \"Pinewood Valley\"; another vocal trio track, \"My Florida Sunshine\"; and A. P. Carter 's \" Wabash Cannon Ball \". The vocal trio featured Wayne Lewis on lead, Monroe on tenor and Randy Davis on baritone.\n\nReception\n\nBluegrass Memories received positive reviews from critics. Cash Box magazine praised Monroe on the album for his decision to \"remain close to the original 'Monroe sound' in spite of recent experimental changes by some bluegrass groups\", while the Walrus progressive music newsletter called the album \"a batch of fine songs\", claiming that \"The old master can churn out albums of fine quality without even trying\". The album reached the top 50 of the Record World Country Album Chart.\n\nPersonnel\n\nBibliography"}

He first saw military action as a volunteer in the expedition against Schenectady in 1690. In 1692, he traveled to France with Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and was stationed in 1693 at Fort Nashwaak , the capital of Acadia . There, he led the local Abenaki and Mi'kmaq in raids against the English (see Battle of Fundy Bay ). While posted in Acadia, he also engaged in trade and commerce, which sometimes conflicted with his military duties.\n\nIn 1696, Montigny joined d'Iberville's expedition against Pemaquid , an English fort on the northern frontier of Acadia. During this campaign, he began a close association with the Abenaki war leader Escumbuit , who also joined Montigny on d'Iberville's Newfoundland campaign later that year. This campaign saw the destruction of most English settlements on Newfoundland . Montigny was given an independent command by d'Iberville, in which he traveled along the coast, destroying settlements and fishing stages . However, the expedition had no lasting implications, as the English quickly rebuilt and fortified some of the settlements.\n\nMontigny was promoted to lieutenant in 1700. In 1704, he returned to Acadia, where he helped orchestrate raids against English settlements and worked to convince the Abenakis to resettle closer to French territories. In the winter of 1704-05, he led a band of Abenakis to Newfoundland to replicate d'Iberville's 1696 expedition under the command of Daniel d'Auger de Subercase . They destroyed several English settlements but were unable to capture St. John's , the English capital.\n\nIn 1706, Montigny traveled to France with Escumbuit, where they were received by King Louis XIV . He participated in an expedition in 1709 to counter a potential English advance on Lake Champlain . The English did not progress beyond the southern end of the lake, and the only military action was a brief skirmish near Crown Point . Montigny was awarded the Order of Saint Louis in 1712 and, in 1721, was given command of a frontier fort on Green Bay . There, he maintained good relations with the Fox and was visited by Escumbuit. By 1726, he had returned to Montreal, and in 1730, he was appointed commandant of Fort Michilimackinac , a post he held for three years before retiring.\n\nMontigny died in Montreal in 1737. He was married twice and had seven children.\n\nLegacy\n\nJacques Testard de Montigny is remembered for his military service in New France and his interactions with Indigenous leaders. His great-grandson, Casimir-Amable Testard de Montigny , continued the family legacy."}
