He was one of the 'Eight Ascetics,' who also included Amir ibn Abd al-Qays , Uways al-Qarani , Al-Rabi ibn Khuthaym , al-Aswad ibn Yazid , Masruq ibn al-Ajda' , Sufyan al-Thawri ibn Said and Hasan al-Basri .\n\nStories of his life\n\nSheikh 'Aa'id Abdullah al-Qarni said that Al Aswad al `Ansi, a man in Yemen who claimed prophethood, asked Abu Muslim to believe in him and testify that he is a messenger. Abu Muslim told him:  \"I can't hear a thing.\" Al Aswad al `Ansi prepared firewood and threw him in fire. Abu Muslim said: \" Hasbuna'Llah wa ni`mal wakeel (\" Allah is sufficient for us and He is the best Protector\", words that Muslims believe Ibrahim ( Abraham ) said when he was thrown in fire, so God made the fire cool and safe for him. Al-\u2018Ansi\u2019s advisors told him that if he did not banish Abu Muslim from Yemen , he would be a source of Fitnah for his followers. So, Abu Muslim was ordered to leave the land. He travelled to Al-Madeenah and upon arriving there, he dismounted from his camel and entered the Masjid to perform prayer. \u2018Umar saw him, so he approached this stranger and said, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d Abu Muslim said, \u201cYemen.\u201d \u2018Umar inquired, \"Tell me about the man whom the liar threw into the fire?\" Abu Muslim said, \u201cHis name is \u2018Abdullaah ibn Thawb.\u201d \u2018Umar said, \u201cTell me, by Allaah, are you him?\u201d He replied, \u201cBy Allaah, yes!\u201d \u2018Umar embraced him with tearful eyes then seated him between him and Abu Bakr and said, \u201cPraise be to Allaah who did not take my soul until I saw a man from the nation of Muhammad to whom was done what was done to Ibraaheem Al-Khaleel.\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring the campaigns against the Byzantines\n\nHistorian of Islam David Cook cites another story:\n\n\"We [the Muslim troops] came from the land of the Byzantines returning [from battle]; when we had left Homs going towards Damascus we passed by a cultivated place which is near Homs\u2014about four miles\u2014at the end of the night. When the monk who was in the cell heard our speech, he came up to us and said: 'Who are you all?' We said: 'People from Damascus, coming from the land of the Byzantines.' He said: 'Do you know Abu Muslim al-Khawlani?' We said: 'Yes.' He said: 'When you come to him, greet him with the peace, and inform him that we find him in the Holy Books as a companion of Jesus son of Mary '.\"\n\nCook says that the Christian monk saw a spiritual kinship with the Muslim, Abu Muslim al-Khawlani said that when Jesus returns Abu Muslim will be a follower of Jesus.\n\nAbu Muslim al-Khawlani died during the reign of Muawiya II in an expedition against the Byzantines. His last request to his commander was: \n\"Put me in charge of the Muslims who died fighting with you, and tie for me a banner of military command over them, and make my grave the furthest of all graves [and the nearest] to the enemy, since I wish to arrive on Resurrection Day carrying their banner.\"\n\nNotes"}

He resigned following the MV Princess Ashika disaster.\n\nKaralus is from Taranaki . He had worked in airline management, and as a coffee farmer and exporter before entering politics.\n\nIn May 2006 he was appointed Minister for Civil Aviation, Marine and Ports by Prime Minister Feleti Sevele . Following the 2006 Nuku\u02bbalofa riots he was responsible for organising the rebuild of Nuku\u02bbalofa 's central business district. The funding of the rebuild via a US$50 million loan from China caused controversy and further pro-democracy protests.\n\nOn 5 August 2009 the MV Princess Ashika sank, killing 74 people. Karalus resigned six days later. During the subsequent Commission of Inquiry Karalus was criticised by officials for mishandling his portfolio and making decision swithout their advice; he in turn blamed officials for the disaster. The final report of the inquiry found that he had lied and provided false information to the government and parliament about the state of the vessel. In August 2010 he sought a judicial review of the adverse findings. The appeal was rejected. Following the conviction of Ashika' s captain in a criminal trial, relatives of the victims called for Karalus' prosecution. In April 2011 he apologised for the disaster.\n\nIn September 2012 a parliamentary select committee found that the loan for the rebuilding of Nuku\u02bbalofa was illegal and has been misspent and recommended criminal charges. Karalus and former Prime Minister Feleti Sevele later sought a judicial review of the report. The application was rejected in May 2013.\n\nKaralus later became manager of Tonga's Air Terminal Service.\n\nHonours"}
