Voters chose both the President of Argentina and their legislators. This was the first election in the country to have enfranchised women at the national level. Turnout was around 88%.\n\nBackground\n\nPresident Juan Per\u00f3n (1895\u20131974) had become President for the first time in June 1946 . His popularity was riding high following five years of social reforms and a vigorous public works program, but he faced intensifying opposition during 1951.  His decision to expropriate the conservative La Prensa (then the nation's second-most circulated daily), though lauded by the CGT labor union, damaged his standing elsewhere at home and his reputation in other countries, as did the climate of political liberties: the opposition UCR 's nominee, Congressman Ricardo Balb\u00edn , had spent much of the previous year as a political prisoner. Economically, the year was an improvement over the 1949\u201350 recession and saw the completion of a number of landmark public works and the inaugural of Channel 13 (Public Television) , the first regular broadcast station in Latin America; but growing inflation (50%, a record at the time) led to increasing strike activity.\n\nThe UCR and other parties in opposition, harassed and deprived of access to the media, boycotted a number of Congressional races and all Senate races as well. The vice president, Hortensio Quijano , had requested leave from the campaign due to failing health and, on August 22, the CGT organized a rally on Buenos Aires' massive Ninth of July Avenue in support of the influential first lady Eva Per\u00f3n as her husband's running mate, though unbeknownst to the crowd, the popular Evita was, like Quijano, dying, and thus refused the acclamation. Quijano reluctantly stayed on; but his stepping aside did not prevent a September 28 coup attempt against Per\u00f3n on the part of ultraconservative elements in the Army. Ultimately, these ill-considered attacks, the Per\u00f3ns' popularity and their control of much of the media combined to give the Peronist Party a landslide in the election, the first at the national level in which the vote was extended to women.\n\nCandidates\n\nResults\n\nPresident\n\nChamber of Deputies\n\nSenate\n\nProvincial Governors\n\nPresidential appointment: 9 territorial governors, Mayor of the city of Buenos Aires\n\nFootnotes"}

FXPAL employed roughly 40 people, including 25 Ph.D. research scientists. In addition, FXPAL had a strong intern program with 10 summer interns each year from universities worldwide and as well as visiting researchers from Fuji Xerox Japan. There were three primary research areas: Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Focus in IoT was on augmented reality and localization, in AI on text and image analysis and in HCI on visualization and interaction. A particular strength of FXPAL was the collaboration among researchers in these different areas, as well as with artists, designers and other non-academic employees.\n\nFXPAL's mission was to provide Fuji Xerox with new technology and business ideas to augment its existing printer/copier business. Lab goals were to:\n\nFXPAL was shut down in 2020, prior to the termination of the FujiFilm agreement with Xerox and its subsequent renaming as FujiFilm Business Innovation [1].\n\nPatents and Publications\n\nFXPAL was known for its technology inventions, which resulted in over 100 patents, filed mainly in the US [2] and Japan.
