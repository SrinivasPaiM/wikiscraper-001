{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_in_Egypt", "content": "Transport in Egypt is centered in Cairo and largely follows the pattern of settlement along the Nile . The Ministry of Transportation and other government bodies are responsible for transportation in Egypt, whether by sea, river, land or air.\n\nWith regards to rail, air and waterway travel, the main line of the nation's rail system follows along the Nile river and is operated by Egyptian National Railways . In addition to overseas routes, Egypt Air provides domestic air service to major tourist destinations from its Cairo hub. The Nile River system (about 1,600\u00a0km (990\u00a0mi)) and the principal canals (1,600\u00a0km (990\u00a0mi)) are important locally for transportation. People still travel via the Nile, mainly between Cairo and Aswan. The Suez Canal is a major waterway for international commerce and navigation, linking the Mediterranean and Red Sea . Major ports are Alexandria , Port Said , Damietta on the Mediterranean and Suez and Safaga on the Red Sea.\n\nRoad system\n\nEgypt has significantly expanded and modernized its road network, primarily through the National Roads Project , which aims to construct 7,000 km of new roads. By 2024, 6,300 km had been completed at a cost of 155 billion Egyptian pounds, increasing the total length of main roads by 29.8% to 30,500 km, compared to 23,500 km in 2014. Additionally, 8,400 km of roads have been upgraded at a cost of 110 billion Egyptian pounds, out of a 10,000 km target. These improvements have enhanced Egypt\u2019s Road Quality Index, which rose from 2.9 points (118th place) in 2015 to 5.53 points (18th place) in 2024.\n\nEgypt is integrated into regional road networks, with two routes in the Trans-African Highway network originating in Cairo and multiple highway links connecting to Asia through the Arab Mashreq International Road Network . While national highways remain the primary mode of transport, the country has developed an extensive system of 4-lane highways that function as freeways , though they accommodate mixed traffic, making them slower than dedicated motorways.\n\nDespite infrastructure improvements, traffic regulations are poorly enforced and frequently disregarded, resulting in one of the highest rates of road fatalities worldwide per miles driven.\n\nSome of the country's major motorways include:\n\nRailways\n\nEgypt's railway system is the oldest in Africa and the Middle East , with its first line between Alexandria and Kafr Eissa opening in 1854. As of 2018, the network spans approximately 5,085\u00a0km (3,160\u00a0mi) and is operated by Egyptian National Railways , carrying around 800 million passengers and 12 million tonnes of freight annually. A modernization program was initiated in 2007 to enhance safety and infrastructure.\n\nIn 2021, Egypt signed a $4.5 billion contract with Siemens Mobility , Orascom Construction , and Arab Contractors to construct and maintain a 660\u00a0km (410\u00a0mi) high-speed electrified railway connecting Ain Sokhna , Mersa Matruh , and Alexandria . Known as the \"Green Line\" or \"Suez Canal on Rails,\" it is designed for both passenger and freight transport. Siemens will supply Velaro high-speed trains, Desiro regional sets, and Vectron freight locomotives. In 2022, the project expanded to include two additional lines linking Greater Cairo to Aswan , and Luxor to Hurghada and Safaga .\n\nThe Cairo Metro currently operates three lines, with a fourth under construction and further expansions planned. Additionally, an Alexandria Metro system is under development to improve urban transportation.\n\nWaterways\n\nEgypt has 3,500\u00a0km (2,200\u00a0mi) of navigable waterways, including the Nile , Lake Nasser , the Mahmudiyya Canal connecting Alexandria with the Nile, as well as numerous smaller canals in the Nile Delta . The Suez Canal , spanning 193.5\u00a0km (120.2\u00a0mi), serves as a major maritime route, accommodating oceangoing vessels with a maximum draft of 17.68 meters (as of 2011).\n\nNile River\n\nThe Nile River system (about 1,600\u00a0km (990\u00a0mi)) and the principal canals (1,600\u00a0km) are used for local transportation. Motorboats , ferries and feluccas are common means of transport along the Nile.\n\nSuez Canal\n\nThe Suez Canal is a critical maritime corridor connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea , facilitating global trade since its completion in 1869. Built under the direction of Ferdinand de Lesseps , it established a direct shipping route between Europe and Asia , significantly reducing travel distances by eliminating the need for passage around the Cape of Good Hope . The canal has undergone multiple expansions to meet the growing demands of international shipping. In 2021, over 20,600 vessels transited the canal, averaging 56 ships per day.\n\nTo enhance capacity, the Egyptian government initiated an expansion project in 2014, widening key sections and increasing the daily transit capacity from 49 to 97 ships. The New Suez Canal , inaugurated in 2015, introduced a parallel lane and deepened sections of the original canal, reducing transit times from 18 to 11 hours and minimizing delays for vessels.\n\nPipelines\n\nAs of 2018, Egypt's pipeline infrastructure includes 486\u00a0km (302\u00a0mi) of condensate pipelines, 74\u00a0km (46\u00a0mi) of condensate/gas pipelines, and an extensive 7,986\u00a0km (4,962\u00a0mi) network for natural gas. The country also operates 957\u00a0km (595\u00a0mi) of liquid petroleum gas pipelines, 5,225\u00a0km (3,247\u00a0mi) for crude oil, and 37\u00a0km (23\u00a0mi) designated for oil, gas, and water transport. Additionally, Egypt has 895\u00a0km (556\u00a0mi) of refined product pipelines and 65\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) for water distribution.\n\nPorts\n\nEgypt has 15 commercial ports and 29 specialized ports. The specialized ports include 5 tourist seaports, 12 petroleum seaports, 6 mining seaports, and \n6 fishing seaports.\n\nCommercial Ports\n\nMerchant marine\n\nIn 2018, the number of Egypt's sea vessels, according to the CIA World Factbook is 399 as follows:\n\nAirports\n\nCairo International Airport is used by numerous international airlines, including the country's own Egypt Air and Nile Air .\n\nAirports with paved runways\n\nTotal: 72\n\nOver 3,047 m: 15\n\n2,438 to 3,047 m: 36\n\n1,524 to 2,437 m: 15\n\n914 to 1,523 m: 0\n\nUnder 914 m: 6\n\nAirports with unpaved runways\n\nTotal: 11\n\n2,438 to 3,047 m: 1\n\n1,524 to 2,437 m: 3\n\n914 to 1,523 m: 4\n\nUnder 914 m: 3 (2013)\n\nHeliports\n\nMonorail\n\nEgypt is currently constructing a two-line monorail rapid transit system in the Greater Cairo region. Upon completion, it is projected to be the longest driverless monorail system in the world. The system will provide the first public transport link between the New Administrative Capital and 6th of October City with the greater Cairo metropolitan area. The 53 km line connecting the New Administrative Capital to eastern Cairo is expected to have a travel time of approximately 60 minutes, while the 42 km line linking 6th of October City to Giza is expected to take around 42 minutes.\n\nThis article incorporates public domain material from The World Factbook .
