He worked with country musicians Dolly Parton , and Glen Campbell with \" Here You Come Again \" and \" Southern Nights \", which some consider the beginning of country music being accepted by mainstream pop audiences.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1962, Gary Klein co-wrote the international pop hit song \" Bobby\u2019s Girl \". He continued songwriting for a short time including \"Guess Who?\" (Kornfeld/Klein), which was included on Dusty Springfield 's Dusty album.\n\nIn 1968, Klein produced Tim Hardin 's Live in Concert 3 . Hardin changed labels and, in 1969, his first studio release for Columbia Records , Suite for Susie Moore and Damion: We are One, One, We Are, was produced by Klein. It reached number 129 on the Billboard 200 .\n\nIn his review for AllMusic , music critic Bruce Eder wrote of the reissue that included \"Bird on the Wire\": \"There's a lot of pain in this disc, to be sure \u2014 it's hard to find a Hardin song that didn't have some \u2014 but also a level of lyrical and musical excellence that one should feel privileged to partake of.\"\n\nIn 1974, Mac Davis , while working on a new album wrote the song \"Stop and Smell the Roses\", Klein produced version of the track won out and it went to number one on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart, and was a Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 .\n\nIn 1975, Klein recorded Johnny Cash 's album John R.

It was the first of three albums he produced for Parton. In Klein's production of \"Here You Come Again\", with a piano intro by musician David Foster, Klein devised a sound with an ingenious idea: placing masking tape across the keys inside the piano.\n\nKlein began working with Barbra Streisand in 1977 on her album Superman . \"My Heart Belongs to Me\" hit number one on the Adult Contemporary Chart and the album went to number four on the Billboard 200, resulting in double platinum album.

He then produced Janis Ian 's 1981 album, Restless Eyes , her last to dent the Billboard Top 200 , and her last album to be released in the US until 1993.\n\nKlein stopped producing records in 1987. He joined EMI Records/EMI Music Publishing's CEO/Chairman Charles Koppelman in 1989, becoming an executive at the company. While there, he transitioned to the publishing division full-time working with CEO/Chairman Martin Bandier .

They were led by CEO Charles Koppelman who oversaw all aspects of the company, with Martin Bandier as General Counsel and Klein leading the creative side of the business as record producer.
