Christian missionaries have translated God as Gitche Manitou in scriptures and prayers in the Algonquian languages.\n\nManitou is a common Algonquian term for spirit, mystery, or deity . Native American Churches in Mexico , United States and Canada often use this term.\n\nAnishinaabe\n\nIn more recent Anishinaabe culture, the Anishinaabe language word Gichi-manidoo means Great Spirit, the Creator of all things and the Giver of Life, and is sometimes translated as the \"Great Mystery\". Historically, Anishinaabe people believed in a variety of spirits, whose images were placed near doorways for protection.\n\nAccording to Anishinaabeg tradition, Michilimackinac , later named by European settlers as Mackinac Island , in Michigan, was the home of Gitche Manitou, and some Anishinaabeg tribes would make pilgrimages there for rituals devoted to the spirit.\n\nIn Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 's The Song of Hiawatha , Gitche Manitou is spelled Gitche Manito .\n\nOther Anishinaabe names for God incorporated through the process of syncretism are Gizhe-manidoo (\"venerable Manidoo \"), Wenizhishid-manidoo (\"Fair Manidoo \") and Gichi-ojichaag (\"Great Spirit\").  While Gichi-manidoo and Gichi-ojichaag both mean \"Great Spirit\", Gichi-manidoo carried the idea of the greater spiritual connectivity while Gichi-ojichaag carried the idea of individual soul's connection to the Gichi-manidoo .  Consequently, Christian missionaries often used the term Gichi-ojichaag to refer to the Christian idea of a Holy Spirit .\n\nOther tribes\n\nCognate terms recorded in other Algonquian languages include:\n\nGitche Manitou has been seen as those cultures' analogue to the Christian God. When early Christian (especially French Catholic) missionaries preached the Gospel to the Algonquian peoples, they adopted Gitche Manitou as a name for God in the Algonquian languages. This can be seen, for example, in the English translation of the \" Huron Carol \".\n\nRelated spirits\n\nSpirits who were either aspects of Gitche Manitou or lesser spirits under Gitche Manitou include:\n\nManitou as mystical term\n\nManitou is the spiritual and fundamental life force among Algonquian groups in the Native American mythology . Manitou is one aspect of the interconnection and balance of nature and life, similar to the East Asian concept of qi . In simpler terms it can refer to a spirit. This spirit is seen as a person as well as a concept.  Everything has its own manitou\u2014every plant, every stone and, since their invention, even machines. These manitous do not exist in a hierarchy like European gods/goddesses, but are more akin to one part of the body interacting with another and the spirit of everything; the collective is named Gitche Manitou .\n\nNotes"}
