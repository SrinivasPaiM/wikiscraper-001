It is a completely instrumental work usually played with bass drums and trumpets . Its vigorous rhythm makes it one of the main marches of the Argentine Armed Forces , which currently perform it in their parades and ceremonies, next to the San Lorenzo march .\n\nHistory\n\nVery little history is known about this march. Oral tradition dates its inspiration to 1915, when the 5th Army Division Band was rehearsing some marching maneuvers in a small village in Salta Province called Campo del Durazno, in Rosario de la Frontera Department . A new street was opened there, which was named after Camellia flowers that were around it. Maestro Pedro Maranesi took this fact and composed a march on the bass drumhead, and named it Avenida de las Camelias .\n\nThe march quickly earned a big popularity, being performed in numerous military parades, ceremonies and internal activities of the Argentine Armed Forces , and played by bands in foreign countries as well, such as Germany and Poland . It was also profusely used during the Argentine military dictatorship of 1976 to 1983, also known as the National Reorganization Process .\n\nNotes"}
