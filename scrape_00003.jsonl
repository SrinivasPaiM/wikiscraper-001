{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandlet_of_Righteousness", "content": "The Bandlet of Righteousness ( Ge'ez : Lef\u0101fa \u1e62ede\u1e33 ), also known as the Ethiopian Book of the Dead , is an anonymous Ethiopic magico-religious funerary text. It consists of a frame story about how God the Father revealed the secret names of God to his son, Jesus Christ , who then gave them to his mother, the Virgin Mary , who passed them on to her relatives. The names revealed in the work function as an amulet . When written out on a scroll and wrapped around the deceased, they will bring him to Heaven .\n\nThe text cannot be traced earlier than the sixteenth century. Two copies are known. It fuses Christian and non-Christian elements. Most notably, it has strong similarities to the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead .\n\nOrigins and manuscripts\n\nThe Bandlet is anonymous and its date of composition is unknown. The existing redaction is probably not earlier than the sixteenth century.\n\nIt is a long text that \"takes up an entire scroll\". Two manuscripts are known to exist, both now in the British Library . The older is Add. 16204, which was copied between the first half of the seventeenth century and the first half of the eighteenth. The other is Oriental 551, copied in the second half of the eighteenth century.\n\nThe contents of the Bandlet would be copied onto strips of linen or parchment and wrapped around a body in preparation for burial. They had a protective and guiding function in the afterlife.\n\nGenre\n\nAlthough the Bandlet \"has a Christian veneer\", it is a distinctly \"unchristian\" text. It has been called a \"magic scroll\" or a \"book of magical texts\". It may be classed with the \"interdicted literature\" or \"forbidden scriptures\" ( orationes falsae ), those that contravene the injunctions of the Council of Ephesus against amulets with names on them. Sevir Chernetsov notes that it is more a funerary than a magic scroll, since it was intended for the afterlife more than this life.\n\nRen\u00e9 Basset , the first scholar of the Bandlet , called it \"Ethiopian apocrypha\". Among Ethiopians themselves an etymologically similar term is used, Temhert\u00e4 Hebu\u02beat , meaning secret knowledge. The Bandlet would only ever have been read by initiates into the magical tradition.\n\nChristian and pagan sources\n\nIn terms of content, the main sources of the Bandlet belong to Christian literature . Most notable among them are the so-called \" homilies \" to the archangels Michael , Gabriel , Raphael and Phanuel . Printed amulets with the names of these four can still be found for sale in Ethiopia today. Another Christian text closely related to the Bandlet is the Ethiopic Prayer of Our Lady after Her Departure from Jerusalem , which is also an unorthodox text.\n\nThe Bandlet , however, is most famous for its resemblance to the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead . This similarity was first noted by Boris Turaev in 1909; followed by Wallis Budge , who called it the \"Ethiopian Book of the Dead\" in 1929; and Sebastian Euringer, who pointed out the same similarities in 1940. Budge specifically linked it to the version of the Book of the Dead in use in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt . Despite the similarities in both structure and content, which are sometimes labeled \"influence\", it is unlikely that there is any direct relationship between the two texts, separated by well over a millennium. Moreover, the Egyptian Book never circulated in the form of a book or scroll and never functioned as an amulet. The similarities between the two texts are nonetheless real.\n\nBudge also discerned the influence of Gnostic texts and Jewish apocrypha on the Bandlet . A reference to priests making the Seal of Solomon with the scroll three times at the grave shows Talmudic influence, since in Gi\u1e6d\u1e6din 68 the king of the devils, Asmodeus , is captured by means of the Seal of Solomon.\n\nContents\n\nThe Bandlet claims to have been written by God the Father himself with his own hands before the incarnation of Jesus . The story is that Jesus showed his mother, the Virgin Mary , her relatives suffering in Hell . Out of concern that they not perish everlastingly in the \"River of Fire\", Mary asked her son for the scroll with the secret names of God . Jesus at first refused, but Mary's weeping compelled him. He persuaded God to reveal to him the secret names. He then gave it to his mother with instructions on how to use it. Although Mary promised not to reveal it to \"wicked evil people\", it has apparently escaped tight control. In this narrative, Jesus plays the role of the Egyptian Thoth .\n\nThe Bandlet is formulated as a plea to Jesus: \"when I die, and when my soul separates from my body\". Yet it functions quite independently of the divinity. Through the \"mighty secret name of a god\" the reader may obtain power even over God. This assures his passage to Heaven :\n\nThe one, who obtains this book, will never fall into condemnation and hell. The one, who wears it and twist it round his neck, will be purified of the dirtiness of sin. The one, who will repeat it during the mess, will be free of sins. If it be made at one's funeral a Seal of Solomon by this book, angels will take him and bring before God in the Kingdom of Heaven.\n\nEditions\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1962%E2%80%931963_New_York_City_newspaper_strike", "content": "The 1962\u20131963 New York City newspaper strike was a strike action within the newspaper industry of New York City which ran from December 8, 1962 until March 31, 1963, lasting for a total of 114 days. Besides protesting low wages, the unions were resisting automation of the printing presses .\n\nThe strike played a pivotal role in changing the attitude of the public to daily newspapers, leading to the demise of some papers and paved the way for new print publications and the start of all-news radio in the New York Metropolitan Area .\n\nPreliminary actions\n\nA preliminary action took place when The Newspaper Guild went on strike against the Daily News just after midnight on November 1, 1962. Guild Vice President Thomas J. Murphy indicated that the Daily News had been singled out as the union's first target \"because there we have had more aggravation, more agitation, more issues, more disputes and more anti-unionism from management\". The Daily News was able to keep printing on November 2, 1962 by using the presses of the New York Journal-American . Workers at the Daily News settled their issues, accepting raises of $8 per week in talks mediated by United States Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz , with employees receiving an added $4.25 per week in the first year, with an additional $3.75 weekly in the subsequent year, allowing the paper to start with a print run of 1.5 million copies, short of its nation-leading normal circulation of 2,075,000 copies.\n\nOn December 4, 1962, negotiators representing the nine major newspapers offered a deal that combined an $8 increase in wages and benefits spread over two years, combined with changes in work procedures that would cut costs for the papers. Union negotiators rejected the offer from the newspapers the following day, setting their requirement of a $16 weekly raise over two years, and set a deadline of midnight on December 8 if an agreement could not be reached before then. Representatives of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service , including Frank H. Brown and Stephen Schlossberg , attempted to help both sides reach agreement on December 6, with \"the public interest\" cited as justifying federal intervention.\n\nThe strike began at 2 a.m. on December 8, when workers from the New York local of the International Typographical Union , led by their president Bert Powers , walked out from the Daily News , New York Journal-American , The New York Times , and New York World-Telegram & Sun . In addition, the New York Daily Mirror , New York Herald Tribune , New York Post , the Long Island Star Journal, and the Long Island Daily Press all suspended operations on a voluntary basis. The newspapers kept their offer of an $8 increase per week spread over two years, while the unions were looking for a $38.82 increase in the two-year period.\n\nAlternative media and strike impact\n\nA number of publications were created or benefited from the strike. The New York Review of Books was created during the strike, issuing its first copies on February 21, 1963, with circulation reaching 75,000 during the strike, before retreating to between 50,000 and 60,000 following the strike. The Brooklyn Eagle saw circulation grow from 50,000 to 390,000 before shrinking to 154,000 before it was hit with a separate deliverers' strike on June 27, 1963.\n\nTiger, Tiger Burning Bright , a dramatic stage play written by playwright Peter Feibleman premiered on Broadway at the Booth Theatre in 1962. Critically acclaimed, the play closed after only 33 performances, with The New York Times saying that the play was \"Fatally wounded by the newspaper strike in New York\".\n\nFortunato Pope, publisher of the Italian-language daily newspaper Il Progresso Italo-Americano , launched an English-language tabloid called the New York Daily Report .\n\nWABC-FM adopted a prototypical all-news radio format during the 114-day strike, preceding WINS as the first station with an all-news format in New York City.\n\nLeonard Andrews , employed by a credit card company, the Uni-Serv Corporation, approached the company's customers about advertising in a publication he created called The New York Standard , the largest of several alternative papers published during the strike, reaching a peak circulation of more than 400,000 and appearing for 67 issues. Other substitute newspapers were The New York Daily Report and The New York Metropolitan Daily .\n\nEnding the strike\n\nFour papers had originally been the target of the strike, but five other papers suspended printing on a voluntary basis. The New York Post was able to resume printing on March 4, 1963, by withdrawing from the Publishers Association: they would be bound by whatever settlement the other papers made, and would have no further voice in negotiating it. The New York Herald Tribune published a statement that they had chosen not to resume publishing on the same terms because of the risk that the eventual settlement would put them out of business.\n\nNew York Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. , and labor negotiator Theodore W. Kheel were eventually able to forge an agreement to end the strike after several attempts. The first deal offered for ratification by the printers' union was rejected on March 17. In another vote on March 24, they agreed to settle, but by this time the photo engravers' union had decided to join the strike, and they did not settle until March 31.\n\nAs publication resumed, the first headline in the Daily News was \"We Have News for You\".\n\nThe printers would receive wage and benefit increases of $12.63 per week. Kheel noted that the contracts for all ten newspaper unions would expire on the same date in 1965, emphasizing the importance of addressing the festering labor issues.\n\nAftermath\n\nAn analysis performed by The New York Times showed that the nine affected newspapers lost a total of more than $100 million (equivalent to $1,027\u00a0million in 2024) in advertising and circulation revenues and that the industry's more than 19,000 employees lost $50 million in wages and benefits.\n\nAfter the strike was ended, both the Times and Herald Tribune doubled their price to 10 cents, one of the factors that had cut readership. As of September 30, 1963, circulation of six daily New York papers was down 11.9% on weekdays and 8.3% on Sundays based on reports from the Audit Bureau of Circulations . The John F. Kennedy assassination in November 1963 helped bring readers back to newspapers.\n\nThe New York Daily Mirror , owned by the Hearst Corporation , shut down on October 15, 1963, and sold its name and goodwill to the Daily News . The Mirror's management blamed the closure on the effects of the strike aggravating existing problems at the paper.\n\nCue magazine (now part of New York magazine) saw weekly circulation rise by 35,000 a year after the strike started and TV Guide had seen a jump of 350,000. Time saw New York City circulation rise by 10%."}
