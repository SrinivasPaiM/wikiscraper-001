She worked to improve women's status in Croatian society, including through producing biographies of notable female figures, launching the women's magazine Doma\u0107e ognji\u0161te , and helping found a girls' school in Zagreb.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nMarija Jambri\u0161ak was born in Karlovac , in what is now Croatia , in 1847. At age six, she moved with her family to Zagreb . Her father died shortly after the family's move, and her mother struggled to support the family. It is thought that this experience motivated Jambri\u0161ak's later advocacy for women's empowerment.\n\nShe attended a two-year teachers' school run by the Sisters of Mercy of St. Vinko Paulski in Zagreb , graduating in 1863. She then taught in Vara\u017edin and Krapina through the end of the decade.\n\nBy 1871, Jambri\u0161ak had already become a forceful advocate for secular education for women. At that year's General Teachers' Assembly in Zagreb, she spoke in favor of equal pay and equal treatment for female teachers, who worked under very different conditions than their male counterparts. She also raised the need for financial support for teachers' professional development, and the problems with placing nuns in secular teaching positions.\n\nShe subsequently traveled to Vienna , where she became the first Croatian woman to study at Friedrich Dittes ' Pedagogium, a teachers' college there. She had been personally invited to study there by Dittes, who had been impressed by her speech at the General Teachers' Assembly. In 1874, she became the first woman to graduate from the school. Her education was of the utmost importance to her, and she would often go without food to be able to afford her textbooks.\n\nCareer\n\nAfter returning to Zagreb, Jambri\u0161ak taught at the Girls' High School from 1875 until 1892. That year, she began teaching at the Women's Lyceum, an institution she was instrumental in founding. She would continue to teach at the Lyceum until her retirement in 1912, serving as director from 1905 onward. Her work was heavily influenced by the pedagogical methods and theories she learned through her formal education at the Pedagogium in Vienna, where she was the first female student. She was a proponent of secular education, individualized instruction, and abolishing corporal punishment .\n\nIn her work as educator and writer, Jambri\u0161ak worked to counter the prevailing stereotype that women lacked creativity and intellectual capacities. She aimed to elevate women's educational and social status in Croatian society, fighting for women's rights and their role in public life. As a writer, she published articles in various magazines including Napredak , \u0160kolski prijatelj , Obzor , and Narodne novine . She wrote a major collection of women's biographies, Znamenite \u017eene iz pri\u010de i poviesti (\"Notable Women in Literature and History\"), which was published in three volumes in 1883, 1885, and 1887. Other notable works she produced included the books O \u017eenskom uzgoju (\"On Female Upbringing,\" 1892) and O pristojnom vladanju (\"On Decent Manners,\" 1895).\n\nIn 1900, she launched the women's magazine Doma\u0107e ognji\u0161te (\"The Home Hearth\") in partnership with Jagoda Truhelka , serving as its editor. The publication became an important space for women's writing in Croatia. Some scholars have cited it as the first women's magazine in Croatia, although there is still some dispute over this. The magazine was targeted at educated women, but it was not wholly progressive as it tended to focus on the message that women would best serve their society by being good mothers and educating the future generations.\n\nPersonal life\n\nJambri\u0161ak herself had no children, but she raised and cared for the children of her brother Janko, who had died young. She died in Zagreb in 1937, at age 89."}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe_8", "content": "Tribe 8 was a lesbian punk rock band from San Francisco, considered one of the first queercore groups. The band took their name from the practice of tribadism , with \"tribe eight\" being a play on the word tribade , a sexual practice sometimes also known as \"scissoring.\"\n\nBand members\n\nThe makeup of the group changed over time, but Lynn Breedlove and Leslie Mah (formerly of Anti-Scrunti Faction ) were consistent members. Other members included Flipper ( Silas Howard ), Slade Bellum , Jen Schwartz, Mama T , Kat Buell, and Tantrum.\n\nConcerts\n\nIn concert, lead singer Breedlove frequently performed shirtless, wearing a strap-on dildo , and encouraged audience members to interact with it. Their songs often deal with subjects such as S/M , nudity, fellatio , and transgender issues, and the band was the subject of controversy because of this. An article from the Chicago Tribune praised their Fireside Bowl show in 1998 stating \"If the members of Tribe 8 play punk rock like they own it, it's only because they do.\"\n\nTribe 8 toured throughout the United States, playing at venues such as DUMBA and 924 Gilman Street ; they also played in Europe and Canada, and released a number of recordings on independent record labels .\n\nIn 1996, the band made its screen debut in A Gun For Jennifer , directed by Todd Morris . The band performs live in the documentary film She's Real, Worse Than Queer by Lucy Thane , released in 1997. Members of the band are also interviewed, speaking about a range of topics including the development of the queercore music scene.  In 2003 the film Rise Above: A Tribe 8 Documentary , by director Tracy Flannigan , was released, documenting not only performances by the band but the motivations and reasons behind the band and the part it plays in their lives. The movie has won many awards at film festivals throughout the U.S.\n\nOther work\n\nOutside of the band, Lynn Breedlove is also the author of a novel, Godspeed , published in 2002, now translated into German as Goetterspeed , and a memoir Lynnee Breedlove's One Freak Show published in 2009, winner of the 2010 Lambda Award for Transgender Writing. Leslie Mah has appeared in various films including The Yo-Yo Gang by G. B. Jones ; Shut Up White Boy , co-directed by Vu T. and Thu Ha ; and produced her own film, Estrofemme , in 1998. Breedlove wrote, co-directed, co-produced, and starred in a short film, Godspeed , based on his novel. It debuted in festivals in 2007. It features Jillian Lauren , Adam Horowitz , Leslie Mah, and Bucky Sinister, with cameos by Meliza Banales and Jewelle Gomez . His comedy solo show on trans bodies, community and feminism, \" Lynnee Breedlove's One Freak Show \", toured worldwide from 2004 to 2009. He now runs Homobiles, a queer ride service.\n\nOutside of Tribe 8, Jen Schwartz is a solo singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer who released her debut album Candy from a Stranger in 2000.  She also owns Rampage Productions, a service business for musicians in Los Angeles. In 2010, she formed the band Me of a Kind. Me of a Kind's debut album is slated for release in the fall of 2010 on the Rampage Productions label.\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums and EPs\n\nSingles\n\nCompilation appearances"}
